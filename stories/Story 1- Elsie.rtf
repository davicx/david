Right well ill just start fro\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

Who would do that Elsie wh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 spered.\line 
Who? Whom? what? We're not sure we think it may be a dark entity that was banished from this works ages ago. A god if you will, but that being set up this tragedy and we fear others are continuing it.\line \line 
Why would they do that? Well we think they fe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l they are helping they want to let out those being imprisoned eons ago in the depths of time.\line \line \line \line 
They think there doing good to save the world from expiation.\line \line She felt they were sailing through space and time the air felt strangely charged. Everyone was\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
quiet lost in there own thoughts.\line \line \line CHAPTER\line He pulled out a curious looking case with a look of reverence written across his aged face. Elsie looked nervously over at the professor, he too sat enraptured.\line \line 
Professor smith sat quietly staring at the curiou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 and ancient box. It was covered in strange runes and heliographs. There also appeared to be some sort of ancient writing on it. The wood was dark and aged looking.\line \line 
It could have been her imagination but Elsie felt a strange sense of electricity in the r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
om. She also felt drawn to touch the box but also terrified at the idea of touching it. The box seemed to fill the whole room and she couldn't take her wyes away from it.\~ Something inside her was being strongly drawn to the box.\line 
She wasn't sure how long \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he sat gazing at the box and it quickly had filled her mind, everything else seemed to have vanished from her attention.\line \line 
It was in this reverie that She felt a gentle hand on her arm and realized she was leaning out towards it, about to touch it, profess\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
r smith was gently holding her back, please forgive me he said it does have a curious draw and I am not totally convinced of its safety.\line \line 
Elsie sat back red faced and embarrassed by her impudence. I'm sorry she said I really am that was rude of me, she co\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ldn't believe she had almost touched such a rare and valuable artifact.
\line \line Don't mention it he said with a smile. I know you meant no harm and I don't show the case often; and anyways you helped confirm what I already suspected.\line \line What do you suspect the pro\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 essor asked,\line \line 
well many things but the one to which i was just referring had to do with the draw the artifact and its contents have on people, some individuals seem to be more drawn to it then others but everyone seems to be pulled in by it also the pull 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 eems to increase the longer your around it.\line \line 
I spend time researching it but feel that it May be risky to engage in prolonged research that involves directly handling or viewing the item.\line \~Do you think it's dangerous Elsie said?\line \line I do he said but not for 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hort periods of time. I still run experiments on it about an hour a week and I usually have one of my students keeping on eye on things.\line \line 
Have you found out anything curious the professor asked?\line \line Sadly I don't feel that I have found anything conclusive. I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
's not radioactive during one experiment we thought that we had potentially detected a gamma with around a 663 Kev energy deposition. We thought that night be a cesium isotope which emits at 662 Kev but the next times we ran the experiment\line 
Nothing turned \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p.\line \line but I think that be\line \line \~physical contact greatly increases the draw. I think that's the\~ the ms\~
 may have negative effects on the mind. Unfortunately my sample size is one, me.\line \line Smith went on, For that reason I never handle it with my bare hands. I did \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t first a number of times but it burned itself into my mind I couldn't stop dreaming and thinking about it. I would wake in a cold sweat strange visions haunting the fringes of my memory.\~ It began to worry me an I grew concerned I was losing my mind.
\line And\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 it's not just the box but the writing and the contents of the box that seemed to cause these strange effects.\line \line 
It is a good thing I was teaching that term I missed there straight lecture and one of my graduate students found me almost past out clutching t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e box. He said I was muttering something in a strange language. I asked him what it was and he said he didn't write it down he called the paramedics. Grad students these days are rather worthless, didnt wrote down what I was saying bah.\line 
Smith covered the \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ox and leaned back in his chair and smiled. Of course the other scholars all screamed it was a ridiculous hoax.\line \line 
Ok I asked them then can I let some undergraduate students come in and touch it as part of an experiment.\line \line Preposterous the administrators in \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 heir\line \line \line 
You didn't mention this before the professor said, everyone said it had been a medical condition.\line \line 
Well yes I'm sorry for misleading you regrettable but necessary smith and really if you think about it did I mislead anyone? Should I tell the dean m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 condition arises from a curious box? And if you believe that i mislead you that would mean you believe this box was capable of something extraordinary, magical in fact. Do you believe that?\line \line 
Hmm yes I see your point the professor replied it is a bit far \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 etched. So what do you believe this box is?\line \line 
Hmm well I don't like to talk about it, I am rather enjoying my tenure and wouldn't my stayin around as an emeritus but I don't think they would keep a lunatic or a scientific fraud about the place.\line \line I do belie\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 v
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e it is otherworldly.\line \line I understand said the professor. How did the box come into your possession?\line \line Ah yes it was an expedition to the Artic, we were studying diatoms,\~
 of course I'm a physicist turned archaeologist so diatoms are not of particular import\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nce to my research the expedition was mostly biologists and one chemist interested in the composition\~
 of ice cores.\line \line Why did you choose to go james asked?\line \line It was a manuscript that I had the fortune of analyzing I think the two are related, can we see it\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 james cut in.\line 
In his excitement he always became blunt but his glowing face and eager manner made it impossible to be offended by him, he clearly meant no harm his brain just lost touch with social graces.\line \line And what do other scholars say?\line A hoax.\line 
What abo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t the effects?\line A placebo.\line \line \line \line \line \line He pulled out a strange and ancient map it glass case and beautifully designed.\line \line 
Elsie gasped my what a pretty map!\line \line \line He smiled yes it's one of my prized possessions.\~ Lord Byron and James both crowded around.\line \line It looks like\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
a map of the Artic with an ocean and a large landmass drawn in green in the ocean.\line \line \line Well that can be right james said the artics been fairly well mapped and everyone agrees that there is nothing but snow and ice and glaciers up there.
\line \line What language is t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 at written in james asked.\line \line \line The legends say that the machine will cause the end of the world.\line \line \line \line \line Off to Egypt!\line

It was a magical fall evening there carriage made its way down the lane\line \line They were All dressed up. Elsie was wearing a white dress and a blue shawl, susa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 was wearing and looked rather magnificent and mature Addie had a skirt and a sweater and Byron wore a smart formal suit. There was\~
 going to be a lot of important people there Members of government, the parliament, Ambassadors There was even a rumor that\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a prince would be there.\line \line 
It was a magical fall evening as there carriage made its way down the lane. The strong white horse pulled them powerfully and gracefully along the winding path.\line \line They sat silently as They all looked at the fall leaves and listene
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  to the gentle fall of the horses hooves on the ground.\line a very light breeze blew stirring the leaves on the trees.\line \line 
Elsie was a little nervous she Didn't know what to expect. Deep down she expected the worst and now as try drove up the elegant drive she e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 x\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
pected a cold and haughty reception. All though she felt comforted knowing Byron was there he always seemed to know how to handle himself in any situation. He also could warm the coldest socialite.\line \line The grounds were impeccably groomed.\line 
\line Dusk had just fall\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n as they rode through the stone gates.\line \line Oh it's beautiful Elsie gasped.she forgot her worries as her And her sisters looked at the beautiful grounds.\line 
\line its like a fairy tale she gasped out.\line \line It is lovely Susan said.\line \line However much they pay the groundskeepe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s it's not enough Byron laughed.\line \line 
Oh my look at that Elsie said they had entered a small forest and lanterns hung from the trees. The forest was a small one inside the gated grounds and they passed through it in about five minutes.\line \line As they left the small
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
woods lights shone every twenty feet or so. Oh look over there Elsie said pointing at the perfectly groomed trees stretching up on the grassy hills on both sides of them. This place is perfectly lovely\line \line How large are the grounds she asked Byron.
\line \line Well I h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ven't ever been here but I hand heard they ate quite large but the size is small compared to the rumors that surround this place most of them I'm sure are untrue.\line 
\line The open air carriage gently rolled on\line As they twisted and turned up the path. Twilight gat\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ered and the first faint stars began to show.\line \line 
They arrived at the massive chateua it was white and looked like a royal palace. To the right near a forest in an open clearing white tents were set up and a small orchestra played on a stage set in the back.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Elsie and the girls Peared eagerly at the site. Well dressed people were every where talking and enjoying the evening.\line \line 
You know Elsie said I feel the party will provably be a little less stuffy since its outside and oh she grabbed Addie's arm look at th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t tent she pointed happily at a large pavilion full of tables and caterers setting up a banquet of I can't wait I bet the food will be simply marvelous.\line \line We should have an eating contest to see who can make their bellies grow the most.\line 
\line Byron laughed and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 S\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 usan said yes let's Elsie couldn't tell if she was being sarcastic.\line \line Good thing I brought a baggy sweater Elsie went on and smiled happily.\line \line 
Well I don't particularly want to make my stomach grow Susan said but I bet I can eat more then you deal Elsie sai\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  shack on it.\line \line Ok Susan laughed\line \line 
Wanna join Addie Elsie said\line \line Yes please she replied\line \line Hey don't leave me out Byron laughed\line \line What should the winner get.\line \line 
They walked out onto the grounds the estates were on their left they walked down a grassy hill into a \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
mall vale where the white pavilions and tables covered with tablecloths. Their were tall and stately trees and from their boughs white lanterns hung.\line \line 
People dressed in formal west mingled and chatted happily. The while scene was elegantly lit with lanter\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s that hung in tall and manicured trees that dotted the grassy veil.\line \line \line 
Caterers walked around with trays full of delicious looking hordervius.\line \line All right Elsie said suddenly serious we all have to eat the same thing so keep track of what you eat.\line \line As they\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 walked Down the path A beautiful blond in a red dress rushed over and practically threw herself on Byron she was very elegant but was clearly excited to see him.\line \line She Scolded him you were supposed to come see me.
\line \line I have been meaning to Isabella things ha\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e been hectic but I'm glad your here.\line \line Yes well who are your friends\line \line You are such pretty girls\line \line 
Elsie decided she liked Isabella not just because she called her pretty but also because she seemed sweet and fairly down to earth for someone so pretty and E\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 sie assumed wealthy.\line \line 
What have to been up to are you still working on your doctorate?\line \line I still remember how to climb trees and fences from my roguish youth. If there is somewhere I shouldn't be ill figure out how to get there.\line \line \line \line \line 
They go to Japan\line Trying\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 to overthrow England\line \line \line \line Great de roam the land\line \line 
The room was elegant lined with dark wood the wall opposite the door had great widows but the shades were drawn, though there would probably not be much to see since it was the evening.\line \line along the other wall\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  were walls and couches but the couches had been pulled out and place In\~
 a semi circle facing a large and imposing desk made of dark mahogany and cherry wood, it looked impressive and imposing te desk of a wealthy man. The room though was full of excited\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
and well dressed children the children of the guests who were visiting the party. On one couch sat four brown haired little girls who were obviously all sisters they were all mostly young but some of the kids were older. There were also a few older boys a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d girls that seemed closer to Susan and Elsie's age.\line \line They barely noticed\line 
wall in so enraptured on the man at the desk. He was a distinguished looking older man wearing a smart dark suit he had taken his coat and tie off.\line \line He looked wealthy and powerful b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t then he smiled and seemed much more approachable.\line \line A young adorable boy wide eyes held a box and stood in front of the desk.\line \line A hushed silence of anticipation settled over the room.\line \line P, p p please would you show us.\line 
\line The man smiled as The child handed t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e box to the man and he said thank you young lord Myers.\line \line 
How bout we do a gentler and easier trick the man said smiling and sitting on the desk.\line \line I bet if he had long white hair and a beard he would look like a wizard Elsie whispered to Susan.\line \line If anyone\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 had long white hair and a beard they would look like a wizard, even you Susan whispered back\line \line I would not! Elsie whispered back much louder then she had Intended.\line \line Susan giggled as Elsie glared back.
\line \~tried to glare at her but also fought back a laugh as \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he thought about what she would look like.\line \line 
If you were a little taller and less hairy you would look like a dwarf she said back to Susan.\line \line Addie laughed but their conversation\line \line was cut short as oohs and awes and laughter filled the room, dang it susan sh
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  said you made me miss it.\line \line Addie had grabbed Elsie's arm\line \line He grabbed the candle flame then held it open in his hand as it burned\line \line 
They all watched in mesmerized silence then he put it back and the candle sprang back to life.\line \line The bird the bird some one s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
arted to chant then everyone did the girls joined in even though they didnt know what it meant.\line \line I'm but sure this will work it's rafter a delicate piece if magic and sadly this bird seems like it has been dead to long.\line \line 
Please please all the children sai\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  at once.\line \line Well ill give it a try, he reached into the box and to Elsie's shock he pulled out a dead bird.\line \line 
It hung limp in his hands he covered it and began to pace behind the desk murmuring softly to it.\line \line The children all leaned eagerly forward some sto\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
d practically dancing with anticipation.\line \line Elsie noticed that in spite of how excited they were they were all very well behaved.\line \line 
The gentleman had gone now towards the windows and stood holding the dead bird. A strange electricity filled the room Elsie th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ught and total silence rained.\line \line 
Elsie felt like time was standing still or movin to fast to feel its presence.\line She began to feel dizzy and sat down.\line \line But just like that the moment passed fled like a snowflake tossed upon the sun.\line \line Then their was cheerier 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nd clapping and to Elsie's total amazement the bird began to move in his hands.\line \line 
Gasps rang out around the room and they quickly turned to cheers of delight and surprise as the bird began to fly frantically around the. Pandemonium broke our as all te chil\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ren yelled and shouted as the bird flew frantically around the room.\line \line He raised his hands, shh\line He said lets not frighten the bird back to death.\line \line 
He smiled as the children settled down somewhat eventually he managed to catch the bird. It rested on his han\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  lets go release him he said.\line \line 
They followed him down the elegant hall towards a back door which they opened and the bird flew off.\line \line All the children erupted in applause.\line \line Well what do you make of that Elsie said to both Susan and Addie as they made their
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 way back outside.\line \line It was definitely a good trick Susan said.\line \line Yes but was it a trick Elsie replied I saw the bird it was definitely dead.\line \line 
I know Susan said pensively, I was sure it was dead too. It looked like it had been for a while.\line \line But things don't \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ome back to life\line \line 
They had walked out into the backyard. The dark grass stretched away and in the far distance could be seen the dark shape of the forested hills rising far away.\line \line It was covered with manicured grass and stately trees spread off into the d
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 stance. The night air was still warm and pleasant and bright stars pierced the night sky.\line \line Elsie looked up oh the stars look beautiful tonight, and they look closer and younger.
\line \line Wanna lay in the grass and watch them Susan asked\line \line Elsie was surprised that \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
idn't sound like something Susan would suggest when she was dressed up but she just said yes that would be lovely.\line \line 
Here wait Addie Elsie said as she slipped off her sweater and laid it down you can lay on that so you don't get your pretty white dress dir\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y.\line \line 
Oh you don't have to do that Addie said.\line \line It's ok Elsie said we can both lay on it.\line \line 
Elsie and Addie both laid down on the sweater Elsie sat mostly in the grass without Addie noticing since she didnt want her pretty white dress to her stained.\line \line Susan \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
aid out her sweater and snuggled close to the other side of Addie.\line \line They stared up at the stars as the gentle night breeze washed over them.\line \line Silence came up from the earth and spread around them.\line \line 
Eventually Elsie broke the silence I still don't know how\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he did that trick.\line \line Yes Susan replied it really was incredible, but I was thinking there really could only be two options.
\line \line What are they Elsie asked.\line \line Well either the bird was dead and he did in fact being it back to life.\line \line Or it was alive all along and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e just pretended it was dead.
\line \line Yes Elsie said but a bird wouldn't play along with a trick\line \line Ya that's what I don't get Susan mused\line \line Oh I thought if a third option Elsie said\line \line What is that Susan asked\line \line 
What if there were two birds he shows the dead one then\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 at some point he slips the live one out.\line \line Oh that makes a lot of sense Susan replied\line \line But she started then hesitated
\line \line What Elsie queried\line \line Well it may have been my imagination but I had a strange feeling when he did the trick and for some reason it felt ve\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y real to me.\line \line 
Me too! Elsie blurted out I felt very strange and, well it seemed very real to me.\line \line What do you think Addie she asked.\line \line Well Addie said slowly it Felt real to me to, but it was so unexpected that maybe I was just surprised\line \line 
That is true Sus\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n said it was surprising we could just be imagining because we want it to be real.\line \line Yes, also do you know what I was thinking\line \line What\line \line 
I was thinking we should go back to our table and have dessert.\line \line Oh I would love that Addie said. They got up and walked s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
owly along the back of the massive estate. Eventually they found their way back to the beautiful party spread out beneath the night treess.\line \line Tye lanterns sure look pretty Elsie said.\line \line 
Yes Susan said and the though of all those deserts made me hungry again.\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Elsie felt nervous. She felt relieved when she saw they were mostly younger children. They all looked wealthy and were well dressed.\line \line He was a giant of a man muscular and athletic. He moved With Careless grace. There was something wild about h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m, he had the look of a fighter or athlete.\line \line There were caterers and a band playing.\line \line Some of the houseguests children were there. They are being watched by their nannies.
\line \line \line Elsie Susan and Addie sat at a small white table underneath a tall tree, lanterns\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hung down casting a soft light everywhere a small orchestra played on a light stage and most of the guests were dancing or other sat talking at different tables.\line \line 
the caterers were bringing trays of desserts around and Elsie watched eagerly barely able to\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 contain her excitement.\line \line 
Oh they look delicious which one so you want she said grabbing Addie's arm in excitement.\line \line I can't see them yet but I want something with chocolate and strawberries\line \line At that moment a caterer had come up with a tray of delicate waf
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rs that had one end dipped in chocolate.\line \line 
She was young and pretty and blond, all the caterers wore black slacks a white dress shirt and a black apron. They added to the elegance of the whole scene.\line \line She smiled at Addie, well these have chocolate would yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  like one?\line \line One?\line \line No I wouldn't like "one" Elsie said roguishly under her breath to Susan\line Susan smiled\line \line The caterer heard her and smiled as\line 
She lowered the tray and Addie and Susan both politely took one.\line \line May I have two Elsie asked\line \line Yes of course the cat\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rer said smiling take as many as you would like.\line 
\line Elsie grabbed two then remembered to say thank you mam.\line \line I'm not sure if she is a mam she seems a little young Susan whispered\line \line and ill be right back\line \line She came back with a fresh tray of chocolate covered s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rawberries\line \line Oh lovely! Addie examined clapping her hands in delight.\line \line The caterer was young and had bling hair.\line \line Do you like catering Elsie asked\line \line 
Oh yes I love it my mother is over there she is one of the caterers I started last year when I was 18.\line \line Your\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 mother is very pretty Susan said\line \line 
Yes she had me when she was young and she doesn't seem to age.\line \line How long have you been catering\line \line Just six months now\line \line Well your very good Elsie said\~ sure I would be awful spilling the trays and eating whatever I didn't s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ill.\line \line Hey do you know Anthing about this place, it's very mysterious only certain people can work here I begged and begged but they never let me.\line \line 
Finally I had an interview with one of the staff here and they approved me, but well it is a fantastic place\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 and I'm sure some mystery hangs about the place.\line \line 
It's our first time here Susan said and we all feel the same.\line \line But sometimes I think maybe they are so selective because its so wealthy and the guests are always so important.\line \line That seems the most logical 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 usan said.\line \line But I also feel like I have been at other nice events and places and this seems different.\line \line Elsie kept wanting to explore but I told her it would be very rude.
\line \line I feel like if magic was real this would be the place that would convince me.\line \line You\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 look like we could all be related\line \line 
Yes she laughed I thought the same thing when I saw you all over here.\line \line My name is Eleanor but everyone calls me elly\line \line I like her Elsie said\line \line Me too said Addie\line \line 
Well Elsie said you should keep reconnoitering and you can \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ell us if you find anything interesting.\line \line 
Ok she said and you should do the same maybe you'll see something strange during the party.\line \line Well I did see one strange thing Elsie said with a roguish look in her eye as she looked at Susan.\line \line And it was how\line \line How\line \line 
\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Much Susan ate Susan said finishing her sentence.\line \line Hey Elsie said that was my joke\line \line 
Susan smiled sorry I couldn't resist and I have eaten more then you which means I'm on target to win unless you pick it up.\line \line Elsie responded by pushing an entire wafer i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 her mouth and marking\line \~Another tally on the scorecard she was keeping. I'm ahead of you on desert she said.\line \line Yes but I have had more dinner by one roll and a chicken skewer.\line \line 
Elsie made a face of pain, oh and I'm full but I gotta catch up. She reached ov\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r and ate another roll.\line \line 
The girls continued to watch everyone dancing and listened to the music playing.\line \line The music really is beautiful Susan said, the while party is lovely.\line \line At that moment elly came back hi she said I brought some cookies these are my 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 avorite it's a thin wafer with chocolate filling\line \line Oh that sounds delicious.\line \line Ok guess what we saw Elsie said\line \line We did see something strange.\line \line 
Oh what she asked?\line \line Susan preceded to tell her all about the magic trick they had just seen.\line \line Elly was excited oh \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  wish I could have seen it!\line \line \line \line \line 
\line \line \line \line \line \line You know Elsie said, I haven't seen\line \line Then out of the trees behind them came\line \line Psst Susan\line \line All three girls jumped\line \line 
Byron Susan exclaimed what happened. He was covered in mud and his suit was torn. Shhh he said I will te\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l you all later I'm gonna wait in the carriage tell its time to go\line \line 
All three girls had stood up and were rushing towards him.\line \line Shh, wait, sit back down, I don't wanna cause a scene he said urgently\line \line Ill tell you what happened when we leave\line \line Ok Susan said\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 but are you ok, did you get Hurt.\line \line I'm fine he smiled a little banged up he moved gently towards your carriage. Your leg Susan exclaimed your cut its bleeding here let me take a look at that.\line \line 
I'm fine he persisted you should enjoy the party and wait on s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 cond thought you can do something for me I'm starving can you grab me some hordervius and punch, the raspberry kind.\line \line 
Yes yes of course Susan said still looking at his leg with concern.\line \line \line Well now I'm not hungry at all Elsie said to curious about what hap\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ened.\line \line Me to Addie said\line 
\line Well I think we were all getting a bit full anyways.\line \line We think these\~ what people are our friends but there are a lot of strange rumors about this place.\line \line 
There was an inner wall quite giant really but I climbed it and say perched\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
on top I had the strangest sensation sitting there almost like I was slowly moving through time, it's difficult to explain and maybe it was my imagination.\line \line \line \line Humans have been drawn into darkness\line \line 
Prime minister is on there side but they find out he is go\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ng to he assassinated they try to stop and it fails and they are blamed\line \line \line 
Elsie woke up. She could tell from the sun slanting in through the window that she has slept late. She lay contentedly in her bed wrapped in the soft bedding glad it was Saturday. I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 was probably going to be warm today but the mornings were starting to have a crisp cool fall feel to them. This morning was particularly chilly and she contemplated wether getting out of the warmth of her bedding was worth it.\line \line 
Eventually she woke up and\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 got dressed and brushed her hair. She left her room and walked Down the stairs. Susan? Addie? Father? She queried.\line \line 
Everyone must be outside she thought. She realized she was hungry and went to the kitchen.\line \line \line Vampires good ones rob blood truck\line \line \line A mastodo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
! A love mastodon preposterous! I wasn't born yesterday you know.\line \line Elsie's face had lit up at the thought and she had clapped with joy.\line \line 
But James skepticism made her smile fade a little but she still felt excited and she could tell by the way James stood\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 up and began to pace that he was too.\line \line 
Well lets hear the evidence you might as well do your best to take me for a foo.\line \line A life mastodon in Antarctica forgive me if I seem a little skeptical but it all seems a little to fantastic. It is and I never would 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ave believed it but these are very reputable scientists.\line \line 
They walked into his office he was younger then Elsie expected and had a look of a well to do businessman. But he also had a rugged look About him like someone who could explore the remotest corner\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  of the globe.\line \line But what stood out most was he had an air of trustworthiness not one to make up fanciful tales and stories.\line \line 
Come in come in he said warmly. But Elsie noticed he seemed a bit nervous and his next words confirmed her thoughts.\line \line You know I w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s a bit reluctant to speak about this I told a few people when I got back and had recovered but they all assumed it was the extreme conditions and me almost freezing to death but what happened was real. I believe it firmly and really have nothing to gain 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y telling my short. If I had proof it would be a different matter.\line \line What about the photos?\line \line Ah yes ill show you but their blurry most of the film was ruined.\line \line 
I assumed I would be scoffed so I kept it to my self m\line \line \line The boat drifted aimlessly everyone sat\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
to numb and devastated to speak. All their friends all the people the rich culture the beatific buildings and palaces and parks and libraries sunk beneath the cold dark and uncaring sea.\line \line \line 
The tidal waves had pushed them far and fast spinning into the gre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t abandoned oceans.\line \line 
What now? The question hung heavy on them all she thought of Julian and her pretty smiling face who had sacrificed her self to save them.\line \line The had been adrift now for days. Hopelessness growing like the thirst inside them.\line \line Happenings
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 in artic enjoy is connected to other world.\line \line \line I suppose the beauty was in the hoping even if what we hoped for never came to pass Elsie said.\line \line 
It still might Susan replied we mustn't give up hope.\line \line I suppose your right Elsie said as she pulled Addie and S\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 san tightly into a hug.\line \line 
He was tall and powerful Elsie had never seen someone so wild or savage looking. And yet he was dignified.\line \line \line \line Mother mommy she clutched her beautiful blond mother tightly as the tests streamed down her face. She was totally overco
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e by emotion and joy.\line \line \line 
It doesn't mean anything, other then that you should try to enjoy your life just like everyone else here. He smiled gently at her. Your mother chose the path she wanted when she married your father and everyone that knows the joy s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e radiates knows she wouldn't change it for the world.\line \line 
Elsie definitely felt like she didn't belong. She liked Copenhagen but it felt so foreign and now they were downtown going to the top of a beautiful skyscraper. It was beautiful but also wealthy and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ustere. It was full of business men and business women and it was clear they were important and successful.\line \line There were also a lot of police and security officers.\line \line 
They reached the top floor and the elegant doors opened to a bright room with a wall of be\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 utiful windows.\line \line 
Elsie rushed over and gasped at the view it's beautiful she said as she looked at the city and the ocean that touched the horizon.\line \line \line \line \line \line Chapter\line 
The person were going to meet, he might be the most hmm how do I put it delicately\line \line Dragons in\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ading\line Magic war\line \line Crazy,\line Insane,\line Bats in the belfry,\line \line 
Elsie blurted out with a half smile playing on her face.\line \line Yes that about sums it up professor James laughed. I don't think I would have been able to put it so delicately and tactfully if I tried for a h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ndred years.\line \line Well we do seem to be on a string of some out there folks I wonder where you dig them up.\line \line 
James laughed yes I wonder but some times it's the dreamers and the fools who know the most but the worlds not ready for their secrets and I think it \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rives them a little mad. Or maybe there were born that way and they can see what others cannot. That and the forbidden secrets they keep makes dealing with the ordinary a challenge for the enlightened and the geniuses.\line \line 
That's probably why I have such a h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rd time remembering to make my bed Elsie laughed.\line \line The greatest thinkers have always been a bit touched madness and brilliance\~
 are far closer then we give them credit for two sides of the same coin both existing at once.\line \line Anyways this one is an interesti\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
g story, it would be fascinating to read in a book but when you hear it I've heard it's a bit unnerving. He agreed to leave out some of the more, unsavory parts.\line \line I can handle it Elsie laughed I'm ferocious and fearless.\line \line 
I have no doubt you are he laughe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  but well some things seem to linger at the edges of our memory waiting for the darkness to come back and torment us.\line \line 
But don't worry you won't miss out on much. My colleague Jacques just told me he has a habit of putting in a lot of detail.\line \line Well can yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 give me a hint of the jist of it you got my curiosity up.\line \line He laughed sure. He aims to have experienced a time slip.\line \line A what Elsie asked?\line \line 
A time slip, where an individual finds them self inexplicably in some far distant past watching history before thei\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  eyes. There are a few notable ones.\line \line \line Talk a about.\line 
\line He had a shock of wild white hair and glasses. He wore a brown suit but it was ill fitted and looked comfortable, comfortable enough to sleep in Elsie thought. (Which in fact he did sometimes when he l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 st track of time and he would briefly curl up on the couch to rest his brain as he liked to put it)\line \line \line \line But I hit learned about this story actually.\line \line 
Elsie had planned for a slightly eccentric meeting but was not at all prepared when they walked into to hi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 office. It was covered in thick carpet and books were everywhere in piles in book cases on desks under desks on the couch.\line \line You! He exclaimed\line \line 
He jumped up scattering papers and cooks everywhere and knocking a cup of coffee over (he didn't seem to mind).\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
I don't believe it! He went on then collapsed in the chair and rubbed his forehead and ran his fingers through his wild hair.\line \line Even James seemed a bit at a loss for words. He had met his match for eccentric mess.\line \line 
How did you escape and were was the blon\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  lady with you the beautiful one who looked just like you.\line \line Elsie sat stunned. She was not expecting this.\line \line \line 
They all speak of something dark and evil that haunted them, the ones that survived.\line \line Elsie looked nervously at the professor.\line \line I've been scouring\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
for leads trying to figure out what happened to you\line \line First we have to get your sisters free\line \line He pulled it out reverently they were three artifacts bound in glass cases.\line 
Originally we thought these were from the Incan empire. There was little reason to dou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t that they were found in a small stone building ruined and crumbling lost to the ages. It sat high in the mountains remote and forgotten.\line \line I have been deciphering it my whole life.\line \line \line 
Well James said the city he found has never been located again. He mayb\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  was confused.\line \line It's a prophecy foretelling the end of the world\line \line 
One of the Incans a great prophet was taken to watch the end of the world. He wrote about it in detail. Well we think it's difficult to decipher.\line \line Elsie looked over at James he seemed incre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ulous too.\line \line \line \line I wouldn't want to get their hopes up it seems like such a difficult story to believe\line \line \line 
The ship tossed and turned on the great sea. Elsie liked standing on the deck and watching the ocean which spread forever as far as the eyes could see. I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  felt lonely but she like the feeling.
\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line FIGHT\line \line \line \line \line \line CHAPTER\line 
Elsie heard the light click and saw the door slide silently open. Whose there she said timidly pulling the blankets up as if those might somehow protect her. In spite of her fear \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he still noticed how rough they felt. Nothing like the soft blankets of her home, and her comfortable cozy little room. For a few seconds there was no more noise and Elsie thought she imagined it. Her thoughts turned back to her cozy room and her sisters 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nd father.\line \line Then she heard it again her insides gave a lurch as she saw the door ghost open apparently on its own accord.\line \line She almost screamed in terror but couldn't.\line 
\line Shh she heard someone say, I've come to get you out of here your in danger.\line \line Two though\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s crossed her mind to scream for help and to silently trust him. She decided to trust him then run when she made it out side.\line \line It was the coldest winter they had had in ages.\line \line \line 
Elsie woke with a start, if she had been in her own comfortable bed she probab\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y would have screamed, but instead she just froze itching the blankets close as if they could somehow save her.
\line \line She tried to ask whose there but the words froze in her mouth. A dark shape glided in and whispered shh speak quietly.\~ I've come to get you o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t of here.\line \line 
your a girl! Elsie exclaimed far louder then she meant to.\line \line Shh yes she said, were you expecting a man she asked a slight trace of humor ran through her words but\line Her words seemed playful almost but Elsie wasnt quite sure.\line \line Elsie
\~ notice she w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s sleepy and confused. UBy now she had sat up and was trying to peer through the dark at who it was that had come so unexpectedly into her room in the middle of the night.\line 
\line Elsie was still trying to decide if she could trust the stranger as the thought cr\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ssed her mind that she seemed to have a lovely voice, it would have been soothing in any other situation.\line \line \line We need to hurry we don't have much time she said now with a sense if urgency.\line \line 
How do I know I can trust you Alesia asked and why shouldn't I scre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m for help?\line \line 
Help, from your captors. Trust me there nothing but pawns but that doesn't make them any less dangerous. In fact your in grave danger.\line \line The more she spoke the more Elsie found herself trusting her. In any other situation she wouldn't have fin
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  but she decided to tag along then run for it or scream for help in the street.\line \line Her voice was the last thing Elsie expected.\line \line 
Ok I'm coming Elsie said but I still don't know if I can trust you if you try anything ills scream for help and kick and bite an\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  punch you.\line \line 
Her voice softened, I'm sure you will by there won't be any need of that.\line \line I'm tessa she said. But come if we're to get away we must go now.\line \line 
Elsie groped in the dark as she quickly put on her pants and sweater. She buried her face briefly in\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
the softness of her favorite sweater, the one comforting link she had left from the life she had been so violently torn from. A brief vision passed quickly through her mind of hugging her mother after she had bought her the sweater, it had always been her
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 favorite.\line \line 
She chocked back the piercing pain of sorrow and it fled away through the darkness As Tessa slowly opened the door. Once again fear grabbed her, could she trust whoever this was?\line \line Elsie saw in the dim hall might she was wearing tight black legg
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ngs and a black shirt. Elsie realized she had an athletic body and was also graceful she reminded her of a ballerina and a gymnast. Elsie tried to she her face but couldn't it was cloaked. She wore a robe and carried a short staff.\line \line 
She was athletic and g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 aceful and even though and couldn't see her face she felt she could trust her.\line \line 
All right when we get in the hall don't make any noise. There is a car waiting for us outside.\line \line She worried she was being\line \line \line She felt she was surrounded by strong powerful rush\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ng wind and the air felt electric full of power and force.\line \line The swirling eddies of chaos and calm colliding.\~ Elsie quickly felt disorientated grab ahold of me closely Tessa shouted above the raging turmoil.\line 
\line Elsie clutched her tightly and felt better. Sh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  was surprised how strong and powrerful she felt but also comforting.\line \line Oh no she heard her gasp.\line \line \line 
Her voice seemed deep and powerful everything stood still and lightning seemed to fill the air but then there iwas an exhausted pause Her voice became less \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
eep but far wilder the electricity seemed to gather around the ground she caught a glance of get beautiful face and was shocked by the exhaustion written so plainly\line Then it felt like the gathering of a wild storm compressed into endless seconds\line 
\line She raise\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  her staff and lightning split the air and then time seemed to return to its normal pace fur everyone\line \line I normally like to use my magic for growing and healing things
\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line CHAPTER\line \line They walked slowly beneath the warm autumn night through the path with\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 its stately trees blowing\~
 gently in the wind. The stars shown against the night sky piercingly bright and the dim glow of the city lights shown faintly ahead of them.\line \line The path winded slowly thought the soft lamplight next to stone benches ahead and to t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 eir left past the great trees that arched above them the campus lawns stretched.\line \line In the distance they could see the soft glow of the campus lights.\line \line 
They walked slowly, each lost in their own thoughts.\line \line The stars shown above them piercing the nights sky.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Finally Elsie broke the silence, what do you think this all means.\line \line 
James came out of his reverie\line \line It's difficult to say he said slowly. It's like trying to catch the moonlight it shines and shimmers but you can never grasp it.\line \line Elsie but her lip she fel\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  troubled. I wish things could go back to the way they used to be.\line \line James felt his heart stir with pity for her.\line \line Well we sure will try.\line \line 
This Incan manuscript describes a women that sounded just like your mother it says they tried to talk to her but she \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 led though the jungle and left this necklace.\line \line 
But that was so long ago it must be some hoax.\line \line Why didn't they take me\line \line I don't think that you interests them at the time.\line \line \line I think we may finally have a lead James said excitedly. He went to Japan, Japan w
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y Japan he seems far to ancient to travel.\line \line 
There was many advanced civilizations long before us. Great beings gods if you we were unleashed some sat they came from another world. They destroyed or buried most of this world. For a time the world was barre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  devoid of any living things.\line \line \line We're drifting further from the sun. They sealed them with blood. DNA\line \line \line 
She felt like she was standing by the ocean on a windy day where it's a struggle even to walk across the sand. But she was aware that nothing was movin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 she also realized her perception seemed far greater, it was a strange duality of both chaos and calm.\line \line Are you ok he asked?\line \line Yes I definitely feel something\line \line 
Two giant men they had hideous masks and were clad in black and red they had giant pulls that se\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 med to be charged with electricity.\line \line 
Your world is in far graver danger then our world.\line \line What\line \line What do you mean\line \line Why?\line \line \line They walked slowly down the hall\line \line Earths original inhabitants been in hiding\line \line \line \line 
We think they might be magicians from a culture we thou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ht long since lost.\line \line \line 
I don't think you want to do that he said calmly and gently, yet there was a surprising power to his words.\line \line \line They walked through the gentle breeze of the late summer night. Tall stately trees lined the path and lampposts shown on ei
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 her side in regular intervals giving just enough light. The moon hung silently overhead watching the quiet world.\line \line 
Across the grass on the left they could see the lights of te great university and on the right the soft glow of the city lights below.\line \line It's\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
beautiful up here Elsie said almost afraid to break the stillness.\line \line Yes I love it, I was an undergraduate here, he sighed and Elsie looked at him, he was lost in thought of some memory of the past.\line \line 
Elsie didnt want to interrupt it was a look of bith sadn\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ss and joy.\line \line You know he said with a slight smile, I wasn't always so, how shall we say dignified.\line \line 
Elsie cut in you were very handsome when your were young, she stopped herself not wanting to be rude but he didn't seem to notice.\line \line He went on I was vey sh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
. My father was a coal miner and a good man, very hardworking but we were poor, very poor and rough. I shared a room with my five brothers and sisters.\line \line They kept walking as Elsie listened to the crickets.\line \line 
After I finished my degree I felt quite lost. I \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 orked a lot of odd jobs and just drifted for a number of years, I really had never done very well in school i never had much confidence.\line 
\line A girl! It was a girl what happened if you don't mind taking about it.\line \line Yes, me smiled love is a driving force in thi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 world and a good one. And not just romantic love but the love between friends, the love of a mother the love that binds you and your sisters and the love for a warm fire on a cold night.\line \line And food Elsie chimed in,\line \line 
Yes that too he laughed especially that.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
And those things are worth fighting for, it's those who have forgotten what love is; their pride or hurt has blinded them. Those are the ones who want to steal the love of those who have it.\line \line 
They foolishly believe that others don't matter that is they \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ave enough power or money then they will feel happiness or love.\line \line 
When in fact it's others and caring for thise around you that brings joy.\line \line But some have grown so dark they only want to hurt. I pity them I don't think anyone is born that evil.\line \line Do you th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nk some people are beyond hope,\line There are some deeds that are unforgivable\line \line Her friends told me she like me but I could never quite believe it.\line \line 
Eventually I got a job in the mines. It was a very dark time.\line \line \line \line I always loved you\line I never stopped loving you\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Elle\line \line \line 
I suppose the beauty was in the hoping even if what we hoped for never came to pass Elsie said.\line \line It still might Susan replied we mustn't give up hope.\line \line I suppose your right Elsie said.\line \line 
The person were going to meet, he might be the most hmm how d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  I put it delicately\line \line Dragons invading\line Magic war\line \line Crazy,\line Insane,\line Bats in the belfry,\line \line 
Elsie blurted out with a half smile playing on her face.\line \line Yes that about sums it up professor James laughed. I don't think I would have been able to put it so delicately\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
and tactfully if I tried for a hundred years.\line \line Well we do seem to be on a string of some out there folks I wonder where you dig them up.\line \line 
James laughed yes I wonder but some times it's the dreamers and the fools who know the most but the worlds not ready \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
or their secrets and I think it drives them a little mad. Or maybe there were born that way and they can see what others cannot. That and the forbidden secrets they keep makes dealing with the ordinary a challenge for the enlightened and the geniuses.
\line \line Th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t's probably why I have such a hard time remembering to make my bed Elsie laughed.\line \line The greatest thinkers have always been a bit touched madness and brilliance\~
 are far closer then we give them credit for two sides of the same coin both existing at once.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Anyways this one is an interesting story, it would be fascinating to read in a book but when you hear it I've heard it's a bit unnerving. He agreed to leave out some of the more, unsavory parts.\line \line 
I can handle it Elsie laughed I'm ferocious and fearless.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 have no doubt you are he laughed but well some things seem to linger at the edges of our memory waiting for the darkness to come back and torment us.\line \line 
But don't worry you won't miss out on much. My colleague Jacques just told me he has a habit of putting\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 in a lot of detail.\line \line 
Well can you give me a hint of the jist of it you got my curiosity up.\line \line He laughed sure. He aims to have experienced a time slip.\line \line A what Elsie asked?\line \line 
A time slip, where an individual finds them self inexplicably in some far distant \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ast watching history before their eyes. There are a few notable ones.\line \line \line Talk a about.\line 
\line He had a shock of wild white hair and glasses. He wore a brown suit but it was ill fitted and looked comfortable, comfortable enough to sleep in Elsie thought. (Which i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 fact he did sometimes when he lost track of time and he would briefly curl up on the couch to rest his brain as he liked to put it)\line \line \line \line But I hit learned about this story actually.\line \line 
Elsie had planned for a slightly eccentric meeting but was not at all pre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ared when they walked into to his office. It was covered in thick carpet and books were everywhere in piles in book cases on desks under desks on the couch.\line \line You! He exclaimed\line \line 
He jumped up scattering papers and cooks everywhere and knocking a cup of coff\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e over (he didn't seem to mind).\line \line 
I don't believe it! He went on then collapsed in the chair and rubbed his forehead and ran his fingers through his wild hair.\line \line Even James seemed a bit at a loss for words. He had met his match for eccentric mess.\line \line How did
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 you escape and were was the blond lady with you the beautiful one who looked just like you.\line \line Elsie sat stunned. She was not expecting this.\line \line \line 
They all speak of something dark and evil that haunted them, the ones that survived.\line \line Elsie looked nervously at t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e professor.\line \line 
I've been scouring for leads trying to figure out what happened to you\line \line First we have to get your sisters free\line \line He pulled it out reverently they were three artifacts bound in glass cases.\line 
Originally we thought these were from the Incan empir\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
. There was little reason to doubt that they were found in a small stone building ruined and crumbling lost to the ages. It sat high in the mountains remote and forgotten.\line \line I have been deciphering it my whole life.\line \line \line 
Well James said the city he found has \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ever been located again. He maybe was confused.\line \line It's a prophecy foretelling the end of the world\line \line 
One of the Incans a great prophet was taken to watch the end of the world. He wrote about it in detail. Well we think it's difficult to decipher.\line \line Elsie loo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ed over at James he seemed incredulous too.\line \line \line \line I wouldn't want to get their hopes up it seems like such a difficult story to believe\line \line \line 
The ship tossed and turned on the great sea. Elsie liked standing on the deck and watching the ocean which spread foreve\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  as far as the eyes could see. It felt lonely but she like the feeling.
\line \line \line He was handsome and charming every bit a gentleman but Elsie was troubled by him. He was haughty and superior but hid it under a layer of false personality.\line \line She also felt he was ca\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 able of not doing terrible things but of making others do them as he sat in the distance holding his followers in disdain.\line \line He had a beautiful girlfriend\~
 but Elsie felt she might be good just fooled by his supposed kindness. He seemed very controlling of\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 her. It made Elsie smoulder I wouldn't let any man .. Or. Women treat me like that.\line 
\line \line Elsie sat on her bed biting her lip and pondering. She wondered if she had misjudged him. As the others had been leaving her room and conversing in the hall he had slipp\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
d it briefly I'm on your side I'm gonna get you out of here.\line \line I suppose the beauty was in the hoping even if what we hoped for never came to pass Elsie said.\line \line It still might Susan replied we mustn't give up hope.\line \line 
I suppose your right Elsie said\line \line Chapter\line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he fall day spread across the world the afternoon was warm and peaceful and promised to cool as the evening shadows grew longer. The great fall trees were bathed in sun and shadow and campus was still waiting the rush of the students that would come soon.
\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Chapter\line \line \line \line \line She said in her sickly sweet voice.\line \line Elsie sat disconsolately on her bed. Wondering if perhaps it had been a dream.\line \line Chapter
\line They wandered through the dense jungle. Sunlight filtered down through the leafy green canopy that spread above \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hem, like a giant parachute.\line \line 
Drat these insects Elsie exclaimed slapping at a mosquito. I think I would like this place better in a picture I never knew that bugs could be such a pest.\line \line Almost as bad as little sisters Susan replied, well expect for you A
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 die your far too cute and sweet.\line \line Elsie couldn't think of a reply so she just gave Susan a look.\line \line 
Lord Byron noticed the interaction and sat waiting he never knew Elsie to not have something to say back to Susan. He didnt have long to wait.\line \line Hey! Are you \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 earing make up?\line 
\line Maybe Susan replied.\line \line It's either yes or no\line \line Ok so what if I am, just a little and it seems to keep the insects away.\line \line And the boys.\line \line 
Susan rolled her eyes there are no boys in the jungle all I see is trees and bugs and, well more bugs.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 L\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ord Byron cleared his throat.\line \line 
Your not a boy Susan said, your a man she laughed, a young man.\line \line Anyways how long do we have to walk through this stupid jungle. Elsie asked.\line \line Yes Byron joined in, do you know lord Williams.\line \line Oh yes quite right, well about t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o days tell we get to a small native village then will hire some natives to sail up the amazon.\~
 Then probably about a four days march. I apologize the mosquitoes have never been this bad before and I've spent a good part of my life in these parts.\line \line They \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
arched on thought the canopy of jungle, it was like a wild cathedral built of living things.\line \line Susan was more perceptive and noticed a slight change in the air a sense of anticipation. Of worlds drifting.\line \line 
The thought fled away again as Elsie burst out, my\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 bag is heavy how much longer are we gonna go today?\line \line 
Well for how much you tease me for being a delicate flower it seems your the one getting tired.\line \line Elsie felt annoyed and realized it was sort of true Susan was turning out to be far more rugged and athle\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ic then she ever thought she was capable of.\line \line Well she said I bet that your bags lighter then mine. Probably full of make up.\line \line Susan laughed we can trade if you like.\line \line 
No thanks Elsie said I don't need any makeup but all the same she follows up quickly wi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h we should weigh our bags when we get to camp.\line \line 
And just where would we get a scale Susan asked.\line \line Ill hold them bith and be the judge Elsie said.\line \line That sounds fair Susan laughed.\line \line Not to take sides Byron said but I think all three of you girls bags are p
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 obably pretty close in weight.\line \line He knew that they had out less in Addie's since she was still the smallest of any of them but he didn't think it was worth mentioning.\line \line 
\line \line Clouds had rolled in an a gentle breeze blew. They walked though the park lamps illum\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nating the path and tall elm trees towered on either side l.\line \line \line \line \line 
\line \line \line \line \line \line \line Te sea folk\line \line \line Like eerie shadows haunting the dark night.\line \line Evil never goes away it just hides when good men drive it out.\line \line Men? Elsie queried\line \line James laughed\line \line 
And women, and girls anyo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e with good in their heart and courage.\line \line But vigilance is always needed,\line \line 
I guess you will just have to go on being ordinary just like the rest of us.\line \line \line \line \line \line \line it's an Incan calendar and it describes the end if the world\line Aren't there a lot of those then thru\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 pass\line \line 
I don't mean to be skeptical, but well I am rather skeptical. I mean isn't someone always sharing Is gonna be the end of the world and then it doesn't happen, they make a big deal about it and then when it doesn't happen kinda disappear for a while 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hen come back with some new claim,\line 
Oh we miscalculated but you still better be afraid cause we were only off by a year so it's about to be the new end is the world in a short peridot of time.\line \line Elsie and Susan both laughed and Addie smiled,\line \line That sounds ab
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ut right Elsie said.\line \line \line \line \line \line Chapter\line We have picked up strange repeating signals.\line \line Really?\line \line 
Yes they are coming from a distant galaxy but they are strong and they repeat.\line \line We feel almost certain they contain some signal.\line \line Now here is where it gets louder. Yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 remember the ill fated lindgriff expedition in Antarctica?\line \line Yes\line \line Well the diary we found was written by one of the members. He claimed to have been lost in a cave and heard strange sounds. He marked them down\line \line \line 
It was a late Indian summer day in early Se\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 tember. The trees still held on to their green leads but bright patches of reds and golds were beginning to shine through.\line \line \line 
You need to leave he said earnestly, please head to the airport and catch the next plane out of here.\line \line But why James said whats go\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ng to happen?\line \line 
I'm not certain of anything but I just have a feeling it's not safe here and the closer you get to me the more you put yourself in danger.\line \line But please promise me you'll leave\line \line \line Susan and Addie are both gone.\line \line 
The words hit Elsie like a crus\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ing wave of despair.\line \line It's my fault James said we should have done something sooner.\line \line \line We have to get them back\line \line 
We will once we find out where they are.\line \line James thought it better not to mention the disturbing rumors he had been hearing.\line \line \line \line Chapter\line Elsie w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
lked into the Quiet study and noticed everyone looked somber and serious.\line \line Even Byron stood by the windows his face serious and drawn.\line He gave Elsie a thin smile.\line \line James seemed distracted.\line \line What's up Elsie asked\line 
\line James seemed to snap out of his reverie\line \line H\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 llo Elsie he said kindly\line \line You should sit down he said\line \line A shock of panic ran through her\line \line Is father ok?!
\line \line No no ok sorry to worry you we don't have any bad news at all about your father or sisters, he paused but we do have some news.\line \line He looked up question\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ngly at Byron\line 
\line He smiled tiredly well you've started you might as well go on, but Elsie i didn't want to raise any false hope but well James you should explain.\line \line It's about your mother James said\line \line \line Mother!\line \line 
Elsie jumped up what do you mean?\line \line Elsie we almo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t didnt tell you because it's so strange we weren't sure what to make of it, but it's gotten stranger and we decided well I decided Byron was opposed yell we know more to full you in.\line \line \line Well please, fill me in!\line \line 
It's sort of a long story but it starts wit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  an archaeological expedition searching for a lost city in South l\line America quite romantic and all that.\line \line \line 
The rain soaked skies covered the ground, the night world was full of tears and sorrow. The dark clouds that covered the night sky finally parted giv\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ng a reprieve from the dark clouds that had haunted the evening. A chill wind blew and a few faint stars emerged.\line \line Elsie shivered and drew her sweater tighter and pulled her sleeves over her hands then wrapped her arms around her body.\line 
\line They walked silent\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
y each lost k. Their own thoughts finally they came to a place where the trees cleared, the clouds across the night sky had finally parted and above them the cold hard stats shone piercingly bright.\line \line Oh it's beautiful Elsie said.\line \line 
They all stopped to admi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e the sky\line Staring upwards into the heavens.\line \line \line \line \line Chapter\line 
Elsie was practically jumping out of her seat as they slowly sailed over the mighty Pacific Ocean.\line \line She peered happily out the window staring at the tops of the white clouds and far below them the ge\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 tle blue of the ocean. Then she stared up\line At the light blue sky so peaceful and endless as it stretched above them.\line \line Tessa smiled Mind of I lean over for a look\line \line 
No you should look at this it's wonderful and oh so lovely.\line \line Tessa leaned over and watched th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  quiet world floating by below them.\line \line Hey you smell nice Elsie said\line \line 
Thank you Tessa laughed it most be my lotion do you want some\line \line Yes please maybe ill dip my pretzels in it,\line \line Tessa laughed Im not sure how good that would taste but I have never taster it,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 it seems like if it tasted as good as it smelled it would be quite delicious.\line \line Tessa was pretty and athletic a combination of confident and humble and sweet and kind.\line \line Elsie had never seen anyone move so gracefully.\line \line \line 
\line \line \line \line ////::::////\line "I saw them again" \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 aid Elsie breathlessly, almost afraid to hear her self speak.\line \line \line 
"You saw no such thing, besides you mustn't make up stories, are you trying to scare Addie" said Susan\line "I'm not scared" said Addie the youngest, and blondest of the three sisters, "why would \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  be scared even if it wasn't make believe?"\line \line 
Then more quietly she followed up quickly with" where did you see them at?" Then as she looked around nervously, a few minutes ago the late fall afternoon had seemed full of color and beauty, but now the evenin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  shadows creeping over the forest made her slide closer to Susan\~ as a tinge of fear creeped up her spine.\line \line "Well" elsie started then paused looking out at the small creek running swiftly by them,\line \line \~
" it was" she began, then she stopped again\line \line Well go on"\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 said Susan, in a rather Adult sounding tone.\line \line 
Well elsie began again reluctantly then , suddenly spilled out in a torrent, blurted out "past Lana's glen in the pine forest above it."\line \line "Elsie grace Simmons!" Susan burst out "above the glen? You went to the\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 cairns again after father told you not too" you know better then that! What were you thinking!"\line \line 
"Fathers not going to find out" Elsie responded with a pointed look at her older sister. "It's not like I'm a baby I can take care of myself and I wanted to t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

"Just ignore it he made it up to get your attention, and it is a little bit funny"\line \line "Well they are just teasing and besides it's your fault yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
r the one always bringing it up. If you didn't insist on acting like you believe your wild tales you wouldn't get teased." Susan said\line \line Elsie tried to hold her tongue but couldn't, "there not wild tales I saw something up there i know it."\line 
\line Anyways you sho\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ldn't go up there I don't believe your stories at all but it's dangerous up by the cairn thats where the potter boy disappeared a couple years ago. And there Are lots of other strange stories and legends about that place" said Susan\line \line 
"Oh please, it's perf\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ctly safe that's just a rumor and besides I've seen them and they are beautiful and friendly." She paused unwilling to go on.\line \line 
Elsie bit her lip as she sat thinking and gazing out at the soft evening sunlight that filtered through the autumn leaves. makin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 patches of sun and shade That played with each other on the surface of the creek\line That danced upon the ground.\line that seemed to be playing with each other on the surface of the creek and upon the ground around them.\line \line 
The three girls sat in silence only brok\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
n by the gentle creek tumbling slowly down to the sea and the light evening breeze that caused the leaves to gently bend and twist (in the evening sun) causing a kaleidoscope of shadow and sun. trying to hold into their\line \line 
they were reluctant to let go of t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 eir summer glory when they were strong and green.\line \line 
Eventually Susan looked over at her sister not quite sure what to say her imagination was maybe a little too active, but she really seemed to believe her latest stories.\line \line She decided to change the subject\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 and ground it back in reality, "of course Some people say the potter boy just ran away to sea, and i wouldnt blame him id run away too if father had as much ear hair as mr potter. All the girls laughed.\line \line 
I suppose we should feel sorry for him Elsie said.\line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
es that's true said Susan feeling bad about her joke... I have only seen him twice but he sure looked mean all hunched over and dressed in black with his cane and top hat. She shuddered at the thought of the Mean looking old man she had seen in the city.
\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Even hunched over he towered over me.\line \line I bet he would have tried to hit me with his cane if I had gotten close enough Susan said. He looks like the kind of old man that would swing his cane at kids.
\line \line That's what I want to be like when I get older Elsie sa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d proudly.\line \line An old man Susan said. Queried\line \line 
No an old women but it sounds fun to swing by cane at children and yell at them.\line \line Well you are still a child Susan replied which is even more obvious with comments like that.\line \line I won't have to swing my cane just 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t children you know\line Elsie went on\line I can swing it at pesty older sisters too.\line \line 
Susan rolled her eyes anyways she went on I heard a rumor from Maggie that mr potter was strict and cold always demanding."and his father was into the dark arts she lived in the\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
village near where his place was before she moved here.\line \line Also Mother said that their boy was strikingly good looking almost beautiful she said she never did see how he was related to old mr potter.\line \line 
Yes and he was wild I heard, young Bacchus was his nickn\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 me.\line \line I tried to ask her more about him one night but she wouldn't say anything else about it.\line \line 
Well Susan said trying to convince herself, "Everyone\~ knows he ran away to sea" so there is nothing to worry about"\line \line Hmm Elsie said pensively i dont know what \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
o believe but that does make more sense then some of the more wild stories and besides I don't think anything up at the cairn is dangerous just beautiful and strange so if he went some where he probably wanted to."\line \line 
"That's n, n, not what you said when yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 saw them the last week before October last year All Hallows' eve when you said you saw them right by our house on the way home, you said they were dark shadows that glided beneath the trees you heard them whisper" Addie said as she slipped her nervous ha
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d into Susan's.\line \line You said you saw shadows gliding beneath the trees.\line \line \line 
"maybe we should head home it's getting late and chilly. " Susan said not wanting to show she too was getting nervous.\line \line Yes let's said Elsie feeling the skin on her neck prickle with f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ar "Yes but that want Them it was the Others did day that but I think it was my imagination, and we should get home remember father said he was gonna make us a treat"\line \line 
I hope it's lavender ice cream Addie said, ohh interjected Susan I hope it's fudge with\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 chocolate sauce\line 
"I hope it's not burnt" Elsie said and the girls all laughed at the memory of smoke pouring out the kitchen into the house at their fathers last attempt at backing.\line \line Even moments of joy can be pierced With sorrow when you lose the one you 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ove.\line \line 
They remembered the last time he made them a treat and cooked it an hour too long both the other girls laughed at the memory of the smoke pouring from the kitchen. Yes I suppose mothers a better cook\line \line Move up in story\line 
Susan put on her light blue wov\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n sweater, brrr she said it is getting cold faster.\line \line 
Yes and it's getting darker quicker Elsie said looking out at the sun as it seemed to be hurrying across the sky to hide behind the mountains. I wish summer would go on for ever everyone could live in t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e woods and hills like the elves and the fairies.\line \line 
I don't think you'd like that Susan said. Don't you like the fall and carving jack I lanterns and what about winter? don't you like the snow and sledding and night hikes with father through the snow as th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  bright moon turns the whole evening world to a strange light.\line \line As the moon Sets the whole evening aglow with strange lights.\line \line 
I don't think you'd like that Susan said. Don't you like the snow? And fall and carving jack o lanterns and sledding and seeing \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ight hikes with father through the snow as the bright moon turns the whole evening world to a strange light.\line \line Yes I suppose your right Elsie said.\line \line 
And besides Susan said reverting back to a slightly superior tone, those stories about elves are not very r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 alistic, a bunch of elves always feasting in the woods.\line \line 
It's not very practical said Susan.\line \line Think of the economics the whole picture of elves is all demand no supply. Prices would sky rocket.\line \line Ughh Elsie said your always so practical. Who cares about su\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ply and demand when all you have to do is dance beneath the twilight and feast with the king.\line \line I suppose I have been reading too much economics and math lately. Have you ever heard of a giffen good?\line \line 
Oh goodness su no is this more economics no I haven't a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d I just don't care. How did get so dull!\line \line More like cultured Susan replied. Father and I talk about economics.\line \line 
Well did it ever occur to you that maybe your boring him but he is just to nice to say anything; you know you really are lucky you have me in \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 our life.\line \line 
Ok ill admit economics aren't for everyone but well anyways this gifffen good\line \line It's a bit fanciful but scholars think the Irish potatoe might in fact be one quite wondrous to dream about.\line 
And besides Susan said reverting back to a slightly supe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ior tone, It's not very practical. I was reading my economic theory book about the role of governmental restrictions and their affect on production\line \line Elsie rolled her eyes as she\~ cut her sister off\line \line oh su, really?\line \line 
We have 24 days and she paused thinking,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 and fourteen hours tell school can we try really hard not to learn anything until then.\line \line 
Because I'd rather dunk my head in the toilet then read boring economics.\line \line Well that seems a little dramatic Susan said. What would even make you say or think that.\line T\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
en susan smiled a mischievous smile as she went on is that how you do your hair in the morning get it wet in the toilet then frizz it up like a wild man?\line \line 
Wild woman Elsie corrected her and what if i do it still looks better then the unruly mess you have.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Addie giggled as Susan responded\line \line \line \line Elsie smiled well we all know you have the best hair.
\line \line \line And besides she said her voice rising a little you tease me for dreaming of fairys and elves and forgotten kingdoms and then you talk about a legendary potatoe, p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ease!\line 
\line Ok Susan laughed. When I'm a lord in the House of Commons I just might let you come visit me. Or maybe ill give you a job, someone will have to keep my house tidy. She laughed at her own joke.\line \line 
Elsie replied I can see it now on the front page of ev\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ry newspaper, the world waits in awe as dignitaries and scientists wait for a glimpse of the the long thought legendary potatoe which has been discovered.\line \line 
Addie giggled at her older sisters, and Susan said I'm just kidding else, she slipped her arm aroun\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 her younger sister. She thought maybe she was teasing her a little too much she knew how tender hearted and caring and sensitive Elsie was thought she hid it well.\line \line 
They heard something in the bushes and all looked nervously, suddenly remembering their p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ecious conversation. I suppose we should be getting going Elsie said.\line \line 
It's just a deer Elsie said see it over in the bushes.\line \line The three sisters stood up and began to walk up the grassy bank away from the gentle stream with its small pebbles that the wate\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  endlessly\~
 danced and played around as it slowly tumbled to the sea. By the time they got back to the dirt path that lead to their house the twilight was over taking the gentle autumn sun and casting longer and darker shadows across the woods.\line \line \~They hur
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ied through the twilight\line Back home along the small path that winded through the woods.\~
 They all felt relieved when they saw the soft (warm and gentle) light of the windows in their house up ahead.\line There father was out pretending to work but it was obviou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 he was just waiting for them to get back when he saw them he burst into a big smile,\line \line Hello my little button he said, scooping up Addie into a great big hug.\line \line And what were my three big girls up to today?\line \line 
"We went up to the creek"\line \line \~"we saw a fish!"\line \line "W\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  found a grassy meadow with a stream in it!"\line \line \~"I saw a unicorn!"\line \line They all burst out at once.\line 
\line "A unicorn"there father said to Addie who he was now carrying up to the house in a piggyback ride.\line Well it might not have been a Unicorn Susan said we didn't e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 x\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 actly see a horn."
\line Maybe it was a white horse their father replied\line Yes well it was a little larger then a horse Elsie added.\line And it wasn't quite as graceful as a horse Susan added\line it said moo, it was a cow" Addie finished\~ as they all Laughed.\line 
\line "Well you \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ever know what strange creatures you might see roaming about, the world is a big wide place, why just the other night I was outside paddys pub and,"\line "father!" Susan cut in
\line "And I saw a great big dragon their father finished clearly changing his story and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 miling at Susan.\line \line 
Susan had heard a story going around school about something a visiting and very drunk sailor had got up to outside the pub. He was locked up over night and when he sobered up he was quite remorseful. (I'm afraid if I told you what he was
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 up to your parents might not let you read this book).\line \line Their father was a tall good looking man with dark hair and a kind disposition.\~
 He had a rugged youth and though now a wealthy gentleman he never forgot his humble beginnings. He loved his girls and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
f he had a weakness it was that he spoiled them. But it hadnt gone to their heads and since they stayed grounded he saw no reason to stop.\line 
Their parents could not have been in anymore love and Susan could see why her father was so on live with their mothe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 she had never seen anyone so pretty. As she had gotten older she began to notice some secret buried between the two of them it showed itself on rare occasions as a faint sadness that punctuated thier joy\~
 but it was moments few and far between usually qu\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ckly ending with their father engaging in some roguish behavior and their mother smiling "oh Charles"\line \line 
She thought the secret was something sad but she had never been able to figure out much.\line \~ As father and the girls walked (or rode) up to the house he a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ked them\line \line 
"So you saw a fish up in the creek?"\line "Yes it was a big one!"\line Addie said, she always got more talkative around her father. She also talked a lot around her sisters but she was so shy she almost never spoke to anyone else. There was a rumor at sch
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ol that she couldn't speak at all.\line \line "Well I think it's time we took a trip to the ocean maybe we could see a shark!" The father Said.\line \line I think the weekend after this ill
\line Be free and we can all plan a trip\line Down to the seashore.\line \line Yay! The girls all Cheered \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 E\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 lsie skipped around her father in excitement.\line \line 
I'm gonna catch a shark and ride it.\line \line Id love to catch one and ride it Elsie said all the sailors would think I was a goddess of the sea an omen of good luck.\line \line Oh would you now their father laughed. If you tr
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed to ride one it would gobble you up in one bite.\line \line And spit you back out I'm sure you probably taste like skin and bones... And dirt, Susan added giving Elsie a smug look.\line 
\line Elsie rolled her eyes. I took a bath this morning thank you very much.\line \line By this t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 me they had reached their house and gone inside.\line \line 
There house was large and nice the kind you find in the wealthy parts of England, perhaps you've seen pictures or been able to visit one. Or maybe you are even lucky enough to live in one.\line \line Their house was\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 warm and inviting though, not cold and stern like some of them can be.\line \line Like some of the large English estates can be.\line \line 
It felt like you could break something and that would be ok. Which was a good thing Because the girls did break things (usually Elsie) \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hen they were rough housing.\line \line 
But there father was the biggest culprit he loved to rough house with his girls and usually crashed or blundered into tables chairs lamps walls and the occasional portrait. Who needs a portrait of stern great uncle Winston be
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 had said on a particularly rainy day when they were playing tag as they all stood around looking at the broken glass and damaged picture lying on the floor as the girls tried not to giggle.
\line \line And by the way he said Your mother doesn't need to know about th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s.\line It's not my fault that picture was hanging where I wanted to kick the football.\~
 But maybe we best not play indoor soccer.\line \line \~It's not my fault that wall was so close to where I was falling.\line \line He had played football at university, not american football b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t the kind you play with your feet, and seemed to forget to be careful at times but he was always gentle with the girls.\line \line \line As they took off their coats and hung them in the closet Elsie said\line \line 
"Oh it smells good what is that?"\line \line I made us some brownies I fi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ured we should spoil ourselves while mother is away.\line \line 
"Yay, we can have them after dinner" Susan said what did you make for dinner?\line \line Dinner? well i guess, Brownies... Their father said slowly I suppose I made us brownies simply because I forgot to make us\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 anything else.\line "That sounds fine to me" Elsie said\line "We can't just have brownies Susan said we could will feel sick all night we could have some of the bread we made yesterday\line \line 
"Or go down to the village and eat at the landing Elsie said\line \line Oh ho you have ex\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ensive taste their father responded, what do you think Addie\line \line 
I think we should play a game and eat brownies Addie said and I love whatever we have"\line \line Well we sailed all over the bright big world the orient, the South Pacific the eastern coast of Russia, w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  landed in Portland Oregon I liked it there.\line \line Did you see any indians? Elsie asked\~
 yes I met some, they were very kind to me, there seemed to be more hidden behind his words but he smiled and the smile hid his thoughts\line \line It's easy to believe in anything w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
en your walking home in the dark he responded with a laugh\line Come here he grabbed Addie in a big hug and sat her in his lap\line \line Well the winter nights are long and you can only gossip about so many times before\line \line 
He was gone for a year in the great and terrible\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
war when men kill men because of the color of their coat or worse the color of thier skin and when he came back he didnt talk or smile much but time brought healing and with it joy returned that was many years Ago when\~ was a small baby\line \line 
It is true that a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l wars are evil But not all who\~
 Fight in them are evil. In fact some are noble and quite good They're fighting to defend the weak from the violent And when the war is over they take no delight in violence anymore In fact they never enjoyed it in the firs\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t

But it's a fact that while there bodies heal the scars that hau\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t their mind will follow like a faithful friend until their\line \line But lets not talk of such things at least now\line \line

"Oh I'm sure your growing plenty" Susan said In a sarcastic voice even though Elsie was little more then a slip she liked to tease her\line \line "Well I'm sure the boys won't like you you might be pretty b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t your idea of a good time is doing your homework and not getting in trouble"\line \line I'd rather be wild and free Elsie replied\line \line \~Remember at the church picnic you tried to study Aabd\line \line 
I'm hungry to said Addie lets get a snack and tell stories in bed.\line both her o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
der sisters adored Addie she was sweet and shy. They also knew she was very kind hearted and sensitive so they teased each other a lot but were careful to make sure they never said anything that might made her sad. But just heaped love and hugs on their l
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ttlest sister.\line \line Oh fine said Susan trying to sound exasperated but secretly pleased .\line \line 
Lets tell scary stories, I know one I can tell about the little girls in a lighthouse!\line \line You will not tell that story I know that one I hate it it scares me"\line \~It's just \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
retend kind of like how a boy would ever like someone who thinks homework and staying out of trouble is fun!"\line \line 
It's just pretend kind of like a boy asking you out for a date it didnt happen and it never will. Elsie said then burst out laughing at her own \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 j\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 oke.\line 
Addie and elsie both laughed at her big sister\line \line They didnt mind teasing Susan because she was quite stunning and more and more she was beginning to realize it so they felt it their duty to keep her in her place\line \line 
Even though it was a joke Addie and El\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ie had both been sad as Susan had spent less time going out traipsing through the woods with them. She wanted to study at the university of edingburouhh and had been increasingly\~ more studious.\line \line 
They snuck quietly down the stairs careful not to make a so\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
nd the moonlight played shadows on the walls all was quiet. The moonlight came through the window casting shadows of the rain drops on the wall. Elsie watched them slide as gravity pulled them downwards to the earth.\line \line 
and gave the downstairs a different a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d quiet feeling.\line \line What should we get Susan asked?\line \line Hey shush look the lights on in the study.\line \line Is father still up\line \line 
Lets go look.\line \line Do you want to get in trouble\line \line I don't think he will mind it's not like we're little.\line \line It's not like I'm little Susan said\line \line Y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ur not much bigger then us Elsie said her voice rising above a whisper.\line \line Well anyways I'm gonna peer around the corner maybe he just left the lights on.\line \line Elsie peered around the corner quiet like a cloud floatin across the night sky.
\line \line Their father sat at \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he table his normally joyfyl face seemed lined With concern, his face was in his hands.\line \line Oh no Elsie said, the jovial mood\line \~Suddenly gone.\line 
\line What's up Susan asked\line \line Elsie whispered to Susan poor father I know he misses mother terribly.\line \line We all do.\line \line She was \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he kindest person\line \line 
She was too good and pretty for this world.\line \line Lets go in Elsie whispered\line \line Are you sure\line \line Yes let's cheer him up.\line \line and all three girls slowly padded into the room.\line \line 
His face broke into a smile when he saw his girls. Hello he said warmly bu\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  Elsie could tell his voice was strained.\line \line 
He stood up abruptly and looked around distractedly Elsie walked over to him and hugged him from the side.\line \line What is it she asked?\line \line Well he said then stopped and tussled Elsie's blond hair\line \line I suppose soon you'll b
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  getting to old for that he laughed.\line \line Never Elsie replied back. Hugging him even harder suddenly worried she might lose him too.\line \line 
He smiled and started again well perhaps we should go sit down on the couch.\line \line And hey he said brightening out of his reverie \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ow about a snack.\line \line \line 
I wasn't sure if I should tell you this he went on slowly. I kept it to myself about a week now. But I thought I should tell you. It's strange I don't think it means much in fact I'm confused about it and what it means, probably nothin
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  mind you.\line \line \line \line They found a pendulen\line \line It seems that some archaeologists were in South America.\line \line They were deep underground in some ancient ruins\line 
\line And it's late shouldn't you girls be in bed I know it's the weekend tomorrow but its he looked over at the gre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t clock on the wall, 1230 am!\line \line 
Susan was hungry again Elsie quipped.\line \line Addie laughed and there father said that sounds like Susan while looking at Elsie.\line \line You little wretch\line \line Elsie couldn't sleep Susan said she was hungry\line \line 
When are you not hungry there fath\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r laughed.\line \line 
And I couldn't sleep because of the storm Addie said but I like it it's cozy I don't know what I love more the rain on the roof or when the wind blows and it tip taps on my window.\line \line But tonight's more like a roar and a bang bang bang wake up! 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 W\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ake up! Go eat! your hungry! On the window Elsie said.\line \line So really it's the storms fault I'm still up and realized I was hung, err Susan was hungry\line \line Elsie said\line \line 
Yes it is a bit loud why don't we make a fire and listen to the storm and definitely need snack\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
They all cuddled on the couch in front of the warm fire cracking an throwing it's cozy light on the room.\line \line Susan came in with hot cocoa and\line \line Thank you Susan\line \line \line \line \line \line 
There was a young lad he was shy and often spent his time daydreaming about a girl when he\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 should have been studying. Try as be might he couldn't talk to get he got too tongue tied.\line \line 
He couldn't believe anyone could be so kind and beautiful she lit up everyone she went in.\line \line Even the gods bowed their heads in reverence.\line \line And there was a madcap y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ung man.
\line \line Oh father Susan said her voice quivering.\line \line \line \line The girls crowded around and hugged him.\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line Threats\line In prisonered gods\line 
Wizards trying to untether world\line Capitalists trying to exploit other world but know nothing about it\line \line \line Chapter 4\line She woke,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 it was dark, with a start she realized she must have fallen asleep, the pine trees seemed to crowd around her and the silent cairn seemed cold and remote. The forest felt angered like she had disturbed something sacred something she had no business being
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 around in the first place.\line \line She got up and stood for a minute to gather her thoughts, she felt light headed. Angry crows gathered thick in the trees above her, scolding her\line 
"Intruder, intruder, leave!"\line At least that's what she imagined they sure seemed un\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 riendly.\line \line 
As her head cleared she began to hurry down the now darkening path. She felt scared and tired and confused. It was a cold night so she knew father would have a large fire going in the fireplace. The thought of warm cocoa by the fire made her fee
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a little less scared as she picked up the pace; the wind blowing through her thin blue dress and light sweater.\line \line 
The windy forest path was a couple miles from her house and she began to hurry to make it back before it was totally dark. The great trees st\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 etched all around her and swayed in the wind.\line 
\line The evening shadows grew darker and as fear settled over her\line She thought to her self "I'm just being silly it's just as safe now as when I started out up here in the bright autumn daylight .\line \line Dark thoughts an
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  faded scratchy memories pressed around her as she stumbled home on the darkening path.\line \line What was that dream she had had? It kept pressing on her just out of memory\line \line 
Those were strange dreams i had she thought to her self.\line \line As she approached the house she\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
realized that something wasn't right, when she had left the grass was trimmed and everything was neat and in order and the garden and grounds were well tended. She began to walk faster and thought it was probably just a trick of the twilight. She pulled h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r coat closer and shivered as a cold wind blew across the path.\line \line She slowed as she walked up the Path and got closer to the house and stopped on the steps.\line \line 
Everything was covered in dust and spiderwebs it looked like no one had lived there for years.\line \line Sh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 was confused and started to feel a real sense of concern. As she struggled to understand what was going on. Everything was in a state of even more disrepair as she timidly walked up to the front door. She tried turning the Cold door handle but it was loc
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed.\line \line Susan,\line \line Father,\line \line Addie?\line \line She called out timidly\line \line 
She tried to peer into the window but couldn't see anything. Dark was falling fast and she peered nervously over her shoulder into the blackness. She began to walk slowly around the great house trying \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 indows and the side door, the kitchen door Blackdoor and the sun porch. All locked. The wind blew through the tall dark pines around the house, the ones that were so cozy and beautiful\~
 when the house was full of light and happiness.\line \line The black door\line \line She \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 egan to feel more confused and panicked. How did everything get so overgrown in four hours.\line 
\line She sat unsure of what to do then a cold black fear settled over her. She felt she was being watched.\line \line Whose there she called out . He voice shook Terribly.\line \line Sile\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ce.
\line \line Then she thought she heard a faint whispering she struggled to hear but couldn't make out any words.\line \line 
She stared hard at the forest it was almost totally dark but she thought she saw a darker shadow amongst the other shadows that made her blood run c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ld. She saw or felt something crawling towards her\line She tried to move but felt paralyzed like she was awake inside a nightmare. She knew she needed to run.\line \line 
Suddenly a bright light came around the corner of the house. She nearly jumped out of her skin with\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 fright but then that turned to hope.\line \line Father? She called out hopefully\line \line 
Eeer oo are you missy? An older man he looked like a long since retired soldier asked timidly holding a bright lantern and a large shotgun tucked under his arm.\line \line Elsie noticed he had \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 q
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 uickly and deftly slid the rifle forward and his right hand rested near the trigger now.\line \line 
Please Elsie said, I live here I'm just a little girl (she almost never referred to herself as a little girl but she felt very little and afraid) and I want to find \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y family.\line \line 
He stared at her so Elsie quickly repeated herself\line \line I'm looking for my family, they were here this morning they should have been back by now.\line \line 
Ain't no one here this day he said slowly then after a pause followed up with you ain't no spook or a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 fairy are ya?\line \line 
I don't rightly believe in spooks he thought to himself but that sure seems like a fairy.\line \line No I'm a girl Elsie grace Simmons I love here.\line \line Now missy he said lets be honest with each other.\line \line 
If you live here then I reckon I'm the king of Fra\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ce.\line \line 
Are You one of the school children ya shouldn't be up here playin it ain't safe. Your other friends around ? You best call them miss. And will be back to the village with us.\line \line 
I live here she went on timidly I don't know who you are but I'm not playi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g any tricks.\line \line 
At that moment Elsie felt a cold shudder and thought she saw or felt a shadow at the edge of the dark line of pines behind there house.\line \line She felt paralyzed and stared in terror\line \line Who goes there!\line \line 
The watchmen held his lantern up again\line \line Elsie\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 felt a little better and she was sure whatever was haunting the shadows had fled.\line \line 
This is a strange night he muttered to himself\line \line Eer I'm Comin closer, no sudden movements all right ?\line \line Elsie felt it was a struggle to speak but managed a faint ok.\line \line He beg\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n to shuffle forward his right leg seemed to be lame.\line \line This is a strange night he mumbled to himself. What ill bloody do for a few quid.\line \line Now miss he said you seem like a nice type\line \line 
Thank you, Elsie said but who are you why are you at our house.\line \line They hir\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
d me to watch this place no one else want the job they said there was spooks sure the constable comes up now en then and we jaw about the weather and potatoes. But I watch the place and nurse a pint down at ee pub from time to time.\line \line 
Things could be worse\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 for and old soldier and sailor with one goo leg. Then agin they could be better but I was never much for complaining life's what you make it.\line \line 
I shoul never have ran away to sea but that's neither here nor there whats done is done.\line \line Neither betwixt nor be\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ween\line \line You ran away to see Elsie asked\line \line 
Ye when I was a wee lad I was born in Scotland me ole dad was a strict type so at 14 I up and ran to see then ended up a soldier, now I'm just a caretaker with one bad leg.\line \line \line \line The caretaker\line \line There is no caretaker the

Be off er I put a whole in you big enough for birds to fly through he was shacking terribly and Elsie was too.\line \line \line He was handsome and charming every bit a gentleman but Elsie was \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 roubled by him. He was haughty and superior but hid it under a layer of false personality.\line \line 
She also felt he was capable of not doing terrible things but of making others do them as he sat in the distance holding his followers in disdain.\line \line He had a beauti\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ul girlfriend\~
 but Elsie felt she might be good just fooled by his supposed kindness. He seemed very controlling of her. It made Elsie smoulder I wouldn't let any man .. Or. Women treat me like that.\line \line \line \line \line 
Elsie sat on her bed biting her lip and pondering. \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 S\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he wondered if she had misjudged him. As the others had been leaving her room and conversing in the hall he had slipped it briefly I'm on your side I'm gonna get you out of here.\line \line \line Ow don't do that she said smacking Elsie sharply.\line 
\line Do what Elsie asked\line \line Do\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 't play coy with me\line \line \line 
Psst Susan.. Susan Elsie whispered I'm worried about that bear it could gobble us up with one paw. Susan was also concerned, too concerned to point out that bear don't eat with their paws. Instead she said me too I'm glad it's gone, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ut well I couldn't help feeling safer with it here it did drive away those soldiers.\line \line 
I know said Elsie but what if it was just lucky it went after them and not us. I'm worried it comes back for us, and what do you think of Addie saying its our friend?\line \line E\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
erybody knows Addie's a sweetheart Elsie thought and she is inside and out and they think I am too but if they could see what I'm thinking sometimes they might change there mind They laughed as Ashe smiled at the joke\line \line 
Long ago when the world was wrapped \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n shadow\line In the ages of the endless moon\line A folk walked the land\line \line Come along she said curtly as she roughly grabbed her arm\line \line 
Ouch that hurts Elsie said\line \line She wanted to talk back but instead bit her lip as a small tear forced its way down her face. She felt \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ollow\line \line 
Ahh what are you doing she gasped and jumped away\line \line Your a strange one and no doubt and I'm gonna see you locked up proper with\line \line \line 
She stared out the window as thy drove through the dirty London streets, the rain steadily came from a dull gray sky, a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

Elsie leaned back into the motor coach seat and clinched her eyes shut hoping this was all a dream. She tried to put the pieces together but they made no sense.\line \line Where had she been for the last six months? Maybe she was cr

Ms acted sickeningly sweet to Elsie around him and it made Elsie cross,\line \line Elsie sat on her hard bed and stared through the bars covering the small window; through the window she saw gray sky that matched her mood. She was in a small room with a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hard bed two chairs and a wood table.\~
 the bed was old and dirty and she didnt wanna sit on it let alone sleep in it. eventually exhaustion overcame her worries and she fell fitfully asleep that first night. She had checked herself for bug bites the next \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 orning and was relieved not to see any.\line \line 
They had kept her in this room now for a week without telling her much. As far as she could tell the place was a juvenile detention center her boredom was punctuated by visits from stern people in suits or police o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ficers who questioned her harshly. "Where are your parents?" Where have you been hiding? Sometimes they didnt question her sometimes they told her things. "It's gonna be much worse at your trial if you don't talk now"\line 
"Your a strange child no doubt" "you \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ight be pretty but don't think thatwill get you any sympathy from the jury"\~ \~You better enjoy your room now you won't be living in such luxury soon!"
\line \line Luxury? She thought a bare room with a bed a table and and stale bread water and something that resembl\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d meat for most her meals.\line \line \~
She never cried when they were in the room but she always cried when they left. She also cried her self to sleep at night.\line \line She asked them questions to, where was her family where were her sisters she wanted to see them! We're
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 they ok where had she been and why were they keeping her here.\line \line 
Yesterday a kinder policeman had come in. He was a bit over weight and spoke with a thick Irish accent. "I got a daughter just like you at home your age and all, I don't think your dangerous,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he looked at the ground a lot when he talked like he was ashamed to be a part of keeping her locked up.\line 
Your a nice girl he said i bet this will turn out ok and youll end up in a nice orphanage" he said he meant it kindly but it brought her little comfort.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  She could tell he felt Sorry for her.\line \line 
He reached across to pat her back comfortingly then stopped with a jerk and pulled it back awkwardly back.\line \line Instead he just sighed and said I got a young one at home just like you. You done look like you'd do the th

I'm not allowed to tell you much well anything me dear. I'm sorry couldn't even if you were my o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n little one locked up in here.\line \line Why were you afraid to touch me Elsie asked.\line 
\line Afraid?!\line \line He looked surprised I'm not afraid your a priso, err I mean a resident and it's against protocol.\line \line Elsie could tell he was lying and it made him uncomfortable.\line \line Also \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e said quietly there are some rumors ye see I didn't even want to come up here and question you but I had to and I was presently surprised your a nice well mannered young one. In another life I bet you and my little one could be right friends and I'm sorr

Elsie pushed the small bed to the far wall and climbed up to state out the small dirty window through the metal bars. She l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
oked up and could see the sun in the bright blue sky. It gave her hope.\line \line The next day was rainy and misty. She looked out the window at the gray world and sighed the hope had fled far away. Days went on and she seemed to lose count of time.
\line \line \~Today she ha\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 had no visitors and while she hated the visits the day had stretched on tell she was bored more bored then she had ever been before. Without a clock she had no idea of the time just dark and light were the only two tangible aspects of her life right now 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nd emotions: worry sadness boredom occasionally hope but that was growing less each long day. The room was completely bare, nothing to write on, no books nothing to break the monotony.\~
 She decided to exercise.\line \line She guessed it must be after six because of\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
the fading twilight but wasn't sure. She had just finished exercising and was sitting on the bed red faced and out of breath.\line Tap tap tap. She heard a light knocking on the door.\line \line Come in she said timidly.\line \line 
No one had knocked before as they came in; they \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ad simply barged. suddenly she and it made her nervous that someone would.\line \line 
The door opened and a kindly and eccentric looking gentleman walked in. Her worries disappeared almost entirely.\line \line Hello she said are you a professor? the man looked like a profess\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
r, with his worn tweed coat was a dead giveaway she thought: he had the look of a man that had spent long years buried in manuscripts and books deep tucked away in libraries in the quieter parts of the world.\line \line 
Professor he said? And how did you know that,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 your a smart one and no doubt about it very perceptive but They always like the smart ones if I do say so myself.\line 
Please sir she said, who are They?\~ \~What, whats that he responded, I suppose were getting a little ahead of ourselves he said and smiled at \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 er.\line \line 
I've been following a long with your case extraordinary, quite extraordinary. He said, he had a curious habit of repeating his words\line \line 
Elsie felt a small glow of joy returning that she hadnt felt in months was this a possible friend who could help her\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ?\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
The professor went on "yes yes it's all quote extraordinary, when I was a young lad everyone thought me a bit balmy" he said leaning back in his chair. And look at me now.\line 
A small smile creeped over Elsie's face as she looked At the eccentric old profes\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 or with his over sized tweed coat.\line 
"A perfect picture of gentility" he said as he leaned back and put his hands together by placing the tip of each finger against the tips of his fingers on his other hand\line "why I'm quite sure my students must mistake me fo
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  the university president what with my suit and genteel manners"\line \line 
I got a chance to explore the Egyptian pyramids he rambled on abruptly changing the subject. I've got a picture actually, magical places those pyramids, people just don't understand, not at\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
all, no not at all, it's such a shame. He paused staring off into space suddenly serious from he's earlier lighthearted manner.\line 
As Elsie looked at him she saw a hint of something deeper (but also elusive and difficult to pinpoint, was it nobility?) just b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
neath the surface of his eccentric appearance she also saw keen intelligence in his bright eyes.\line \line 
"About that picture though, here let me find it That picture though here look here he began to rummage through his leather carrying case. He seemed to be hav\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ng trouble as he kept rummaging around and pulling out random and odds documents, old books and tattered papers that\~ looked like students homework all in A disheveled pile. After a few unsuccessful attempts to locate it he dumped\~
 The whole thing out on \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he table. Let's see let's see it's got to be around here somewhere He moved papers around this way and that,\line \line There it is!\line \line 
he pulled out an old black-and-white photograph that had been weather beaten and faded by the sun. He handed it over to Elsie.\line \line "Oh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
my" Elsie said you were quite handsome when you were a young man.\line \line Were!\line \line 
He said quite indignant Let us be careful with our verb tenses young lady. Clearly you must not have learned this yet but the verb were implies past tense, you were intending to use\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
"are" the present tense, My looks age like a fine wine. And let's be honest there's twice as much of me to be as good looking now. He said before letting out a chuckle And patting his round belly.\line I'm sorry Elsie said not meaning to offend the man.
\line Oh don\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 '\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t mention it he said beaming a smile at her\line \~
Elsie knew she really liked the scatter brained old professor. She was a perceptive girl and knew his playful batter was an attempt to cheer her up.\line \line Well you're probably wondering why I came here Would you lik\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a cup of tea? When do the serve\~ tea at in this blasted place. Not exactly Buckingham palace now is it?\line \line 
No maybe if the palace has a basement with an old dungeon in it and I don't think they serve tea Elsie said.\line \line Oh quite right,\~ quite right well Let's\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 \hich\f0 go over to the caf\'e9
\loch\f0  across the street.\line I don't think they'd allow that Elsie said\line \line Bah Nothing of the sort they'll\~ do what's good for them the professor said\line \line 
I've had first-hand experience with a situation similar to yours. It actually was in Egypt near\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
that pyramid that's why I showed you that picture of it. I was in the regiment back then of course. At the time I wasn't a\~
 scholar I hadn't found my true calling Not that being a soldier doesn't have its perks like Getting to wear the same thing every da\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
, and not have people make snide comments he looked fondly at his old tweed suit coat and Elsie got the feeling he wore it quite often, possibly everyday.\line \line 
"Maybe you should try carrying your gun again like when you were a soldier that might prevent snide\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 comments" Elsie teased back\line 
Yes quite right and my students might give me a little more respect too, no more silly excuses for late papers. You see professor my great aunt twice removed d again. Third time this term, rotten luck, so I'm sure you quite und
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rstand why my papers not done And You won't be docking any points"\line \line I bet your students like you Elsie said to him.\line \line 
Yes probably more then they should I'm getting soft in my old age, and did you know I heard there is a rumor going about the college that \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ou can get me to go off on tangents if you ask me questions about my flower gardens , preposterous! my lectures cover just what they are supposed to.\line Do you have a flower garden Elsie asked?\line Starts talking abou garden\line \line 
Elsie struggled to hold back a giggl\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  as she realized he was going off on a tangent right now.\line \line 
Where were we he said, ah yes those curious Egyptian ruins. There are lots of strange places, magic if you will, around this world the ancient Druids and Egyptian priests might have been more in t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ne with these types of things\~ then we have them credit for. The whirling and clanging of machines and small everyday gossip has driven the strange, the beautiful and the magical\~ into the shadows.\line \line 
Do you believe in magic Elsie asked\line \line Well he went on cho\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 sing his words carefully.\line \line I believe in the strange.\line \line 
Lets just say I'm open minded but I'm a scientists and scientists like proof, well the good ones anyway.\~ I need some sort of proof.\line \line \line \~As I was saying we were in Egypt at the time quite a wonderful pl\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ce we were stationed near by and took a weekend trip to see the pyramids. It was Jamison, Charles myself and Charles sister and her friend who had come up to visit.\~
 We really though it was going to be a grand weekend and brought our cameras and everythin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
We took the train out to Cairo and then got a guide to take us with camels out to the ruins.\line \line Blast it all where the d did Jamison get off too!\line \line 
At first we thought it was a prank we searched tell late afternoon and then became really worried. We alert\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d the authorities and the British consulate got involved too.\line \line 
Now here's the strange part the professor went on. We were all devastated he was my best mate we had been through a war together I felt the loss Keenly. I could tend to be a bit shy in my yout\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 and he had an exciting social life there was never a dull moment in university my grades suffered a little but I wouldn't change it for the world.\line \line 
Well time moved on is it is inclined to do the days turned to months and then a year. We all gave up and w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 re left with an empty hole that had once been filed with joy and companionship.\line 
\line He noticed a slight flush of pain and his heart broke for the blond girl sitting in front of him who had already experienced so much tragedy.\line \line He continued on well ten years \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ent by I finished my doctorate and did a post doc it was the summer of my third year as a professor I still saw the girls and we decided to go back I don't really know why we were all kind of horrified of the places for years but we decided to go back.
\line \line W\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  checked k to the beutiful hotel with its green gardens fountains and white Walls.\line \line 
Lets go to the pyramids tonight chalmalebge said. Perhaps fate had taken us by the hand but we all felt we must.\line \line Well we had a lot of delays and ended up getting back to \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he pyramids close to dusk. We see a man walking at us out of the desert we all thought it was a specter, lady whitmore normally so poised and proper clutched my arm in fright.\line 
Well I'd it had been a specter that would have been less strange. It wa Jamison\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 I'm quite sure I turned deathly white.\line \line 
"Where have you been he joked with his charming smile" I've been looking for you the last 6 hours! Jolly rotten to leave a fella like that if you didn't want my company you could have just said something he said wit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a roguish laugh.\line \line Lady anne shrieked and last out my knees gave and I buckled to the ground.\line \line Jamison lady whitmore said in a voice as quiet as death is that you? Where have you been?\line \line 
What do you mean well looking around this tall triangle then I crawle\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 in for a look around, I must have been tired then I thought I think I fell asleep for a spell maybe an hour then I came out and have been looking for all of you. " he had said\line \line 
well I'm sure I don't need to tell you that you could have cut the tension an\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  shock with a knife\line \line 
He went on "I feel maybe I got a touch to long of sun maybe we can get back, you all seem more struck by the sun then me"\line \line Jamison, lady anne went on in. Quiet whisper "that was ten years ago, you disappeared ten Years ago, where have
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 you been and she began to sob quietly."\line \line If this is a Prank he went on you really have got me but it would be nice to all have our laugh and get back for a meal.\line \line 
I remember the next moment like it was this morning he took a step towards us and we all bac\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed up in fear,.\line \line \line \line 
When we are exploring it one of my mates went missing he was AWOL for 8 years then he shows up again one day and hadnt aged a day. Good luck and good genes they all said As they locked him away for desertion. Not the kind of good luck I
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 would want to have mind you.\line 
They agreed to lower his sentence to a year and a dishonorable discharge if he would agree to be studied. Which he did. I met up with him again and he told queer stories some of them were fascinating but some would make your b
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ood run cold. We didnt believe him at all of course he became quite a hermit and a recluse.\line \line 
Of course I stayed in touch with him over the years, eventually he recanted said he made the whole thing up but I didn't believe one word of it.\line \line Didnt believe on\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 word if what Elsie asked?\line \line Oh his recant the whole story I believe he was telling the truth and then later said it was a lie but that was a lie if that makes sense?\line \line 
Um I think so you believe he was telling the truth about his mysterious disappearance th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n later changed his story but that was when he lied.\line \line 
Quite right quite right the professor agreed.\line \line But Why would he do that, asked Elsie?\line \line Well it was before he shut himself off from the world I think he wanted to just go back to having a normal life.\line A
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
out a year after he was found, right after he got out of prison he started to tell outlandish tales. At this point his life was still fairly normal he came from a wealthy respected English family, his father had been knighted and everyone seemed to want t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  put the whole affair behind them.\line \line He started at the university in Cambridge studying physics and\~
 history, Celtic folklore and theoretical Physics to be precise of course the choices are quote obvious what he was going after now and even then I think ev\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ryone knew the odd combination had something to do with his disappearance.\line \line I think it made his father angry he didn't study economics or business and take over the family empire. I always heard his father was a cold and distant man.\line \line 
We spent quite a bit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
of time together, I was his best mate at the time, but I was studying engineering. Everyone thought his choice was a bit odd but he began to develop far more wilder and odder traits.\line \line 
He still managed to put up a good front, dashing cheery a perfect Engli\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h gentleman and he was quite popular.\~
 But we spent a lot of time together and I began to see the psychological tears forming in his mind.\line \line \~What kind of things Elsie said?\line \line Well he disappeared again twice right mid semester, failed all his classes. he al
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
o started to tell stories about dark shadows haunting him shortly after he started to break into people's houses he did it three times and his family managed to get him out of it each time but the third time, well that's when he got committed.\line \line 
When he go\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  out after all that he renounced all his old stories and moved out into the woods, it's quite sad rally.\line Why do you think he spirited himself away?\line \line 
Why? The professor responded, it's difficult to say, the mind is a delicate and complicated thing. Why doe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 anyone do the things they do? But in his case I think I know a few pieces of the puzzle. Some of them are quite obvious I think he got tired of being disbelieved he was always a very truthful man, I also think he didnt want to disgrace his family anymore
.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  Over Time\~
 his younger brother took his place and his family was slowly pushing him out. I also think he had grown quite sad and felt isolated. I also think he had a secret or secrets to hide. He also firmly believed his life was in danger and also anyon
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  around him.\line \line Did you believe that, said Elsie?\line \line 
Hmm, I'm not totally sure and well to be honest my feelings now are that he might just be a troubled young man whose star shown to bright and he descended into madness.\line \line You think he's out of his mind? Whis\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ered Elsie suddenly seeing her life descending down a dark and lonely path.\line \line Well yes and no the rumors made him far crazier then he was and i suppose\~
 I'm guilty of believing them just like everyone else it's hard to separate the fanciful from the real a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d as he isolated himself we slowly lost contact.\~
 I never once had a conversation with him that I wouldn't swear he was as normal as any man can be, which mind you is not saying all that much.\line \line But some of the things he said were and still are hard to swa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 low.\line \line And your case is much different then his what i want for you is to find your parents And let you all go back to being a family with your sisters!\line \line 
I think by helping you I also may learn things and after speaking here now i just want to help you.\line \line A\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  the point the professor paused, Elsie could tell he was troubled.\line \line 
Well Elsie said is the story over, that's how it ends a man with such promise simply fading away?\line \line No, no not if I can help it and that's part of the reason I'm here I believe his story w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ll I want to believe it I suppose I contradict myself. To speak plainly he always struck me as a sane man but his tales were not the tales of a same man. i also have found other stories and legends that lend credence to what he claims but I couldn't sit h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 re and tell you I have proof and for that reason the evidence points to a crazy man.\line 
I have been searching for evidence and I think that you are evidence that strange things can and do happen.\line \~ I want to find evidence that it's true.\line \line Well Elsie said try\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ng to take everything in, I have been known to tell stories too, but I believe them. Well I also made them up when I was younger which makes it harder for people to believe me know.\line \line How much younger the professor asked?\line \line 
Well Elsie replied smilingly weak\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y last year but that's a long time ago and they were just fairy tales but then when I really saw things I stopped making things up.\line \line 
Quite right, what types of things did you see? Asked the professor.\line \line Well Elsie said she suddenly felt very shy especially\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
now that she was locked up which made her feel like maybe she was crazy.\line \line 
Just well I heard whispers in the forest twice and one night, well it could have been a dream but I woke and looked out the window and I saw something dark, a shadow it terrified me\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
I woke the next morning and had forgotten all about it but the next day when I went to play the grass was withered were I had seen it, father said it was normal for their to be dead spots in the grass.\line \line 
Hmm did you tell him about your dream? Asked the pro\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 essor\line \line 
No I didn't at the time it seemed silly, I just asked why the grass might be dead and he just laughed and said it was fall and that's what grass does after a long summer.\line \line Yes it is rather curious, the professor responded.\line \line 
What do you make of it a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l asked Elsie?\line \line 
I don't rightly know, I have some theories of course but there all rather wild. For the first time a slight cloud past over his normally confident and joyful features. He stared at the ground and sighed. But the thing is all\line I have is piec
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s and I haven't been able to put them together. In fact the only thing I feel confident of is that I don't have all the pieces.\line \line Am I one of the pieces Elsie asked timidly.\line 
\line That seemed to shack him out of his reverie, oh no no good gracious no. He said t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 en paused.\line \line 
Well he cleared his throat, I suppose you are but I don't like to put it that way. To me your just a young girl who needs to be reunited with her family. I want to help my friend that's what dragged me into all this. So it is a puzzle but to m
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  it's people I care about and that's all.\line \line You do understand he asked hopefully\line \line 
Yes of course Elsie said and smiled. You want to help your friend, you think we share some similarities and now by helping me you might help us both.\line \line Yes exactly he smiled, \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ut I do hope it's not to late to help him. He has isolated himself for far to long and I haven't seen him in years it's probably Been ten or fifteen now, I have tried my best but never gotten a reponse.\line \line \line 
But what we need is some immediate action you shou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 dn't be locked up in here like this.\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line 
Right then the door burst open it was the driver from the car with his sneering smile, visiting times up.\line \line Could we possibly have a few more minutes the professor asked politely\line \line No, he responded in a blunt mann
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r. Elsie saw two policeman outside they both walked into the room, time to go one of them said roughly.\line \line Yes yes let me just gather my papers.\line \line 
No none of that one of them grabbed his arm roughly it's time to go the professor began to frantically gather h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s papers then accidentally spilt some in his haste, one of the officers grabbed a handful and shoved it it in the bag.\line \line Please the professor\~ pleaded some of these are priceless.\line \line 
They ignored his pleas, shoved the rest of the papers in his bag and pushed\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 him roughly for the door, goodby Elsie he said dont give up hope\line \line \line \~
well you did to missing for seven months and that's hard to make up. You really don't remember anything?\line \line No nothing I was up by the cairns playing and then things are a little foggy but \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 I
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  woke up hurried home and saw the house all empty. She paused as the emotions got to her and tried to hold back the tears.\line \line I think it's time we went and visited him and I want you to come.\line \line \line \line 
\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line Ms Cornelius came in all in a titter like a young (b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t quite annoying) fickle teenager going to a dance.\line She\~
 was wearing far to much make up and perfume and barely seemed to notice Elsie as she flitted absent mindedlee\~ about the room.\line \line She suddenly seemed to realize Elsie was in the room and grimaced, her\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  put this on and be quick about it she said as she went to check her self in the small round mirror on the wall.\line \line Elsie contemplated being stubborn and refusing but realized it wasn't worth the fight.\line \line 
\line \line \line \line \line There was another man wearing a black suit that \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 idnt fit quite right. He clearly considered himself a charming gentleman.\line \line 
My dear girl she said in a sickeningly sweet voice, so good to have you back.\line \line Elsie glared back at her biting her tongue in anger.\line \line I understand your confusion she sad patting her\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 on the head like a child, at that moment another man walked in it was a policeman.\line \line 
We're all glad your safe of course I'm on my way to the London grill, she paused as if she Expected that name to mean something To Elsie.\line \line Instead elsie just looked at the\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
faces of the policeman ms Cornelius and the other gentleman with them.\line \line 
You see my dear she said youve been taken advantage of. It appears that your father had discovered some sort of a treasure and quite a bit of unscrupulous people are after it.\line \line I'm af\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
aid that Mr. Professor took You for a fool along With his associate. Apparently he showed you some old photo of a man that never ages. Come we all know you have an overactive imagination but even that must be to preposterous for you she said Reverting bac
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  to her superior tone Which Elsie\~ preferred to the sweet fake one. She laughed shrilly and the other two men laughed with her.\line \line 
That photograph was taken recently and made to look old. They wanted to gain your confidence everybody thinks that perhaps you\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  father showed you where that treasure is.\line \line \line \line 
\line \line \line \line \line Chapter 4\line Oh Addie she burst out into tears at how thin and gaunt her little sister looked. Her pretty face seemed to be lined with sadness and worry, but her face lit up as she threw herself on Elsie. El
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ie hugged her tightly back happy but worried about how thin and frail she felt. Elsie realized she was crying but that Her warm tears were tears of joy now at hugging her little sister again.
\line \line They sat down on the cold hard chairs at the mean little table,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  Elsie looked around the room which was more like a prison an realized she had it better off then her younger sister.\line \line \~
They sad you were dead Addie whispered quietly as if even saying the words was too terrible.\line \line No Elsie said I'm not and Susan's not eit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 er.\line \line 
They both sat in silence for a while Elsie's arm wrapped tightly around Addie's frail shoulders.\line \line I love what you've done to the place Elsie joked sarcastically.\line \line 
Elsie looked at the tight beds stacked 3 high with little room along all the walls. Do \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ou sleep in those yes do you want to see my bed?\line \line 
Sure Elsie replied they went over to Addie's bed it was on the top bunk they climbed up and Elsie looked around.\line \line There was s small picture if there family smiling and happy mother and father both alive an\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  happy fathers handsome face and mothers gentle beautiful face kind and gentle.\line \line \~her smiling kind eyes and beautiful blond hair.\line \line 
Elsie felt chocked up and hugged Addie as she tried it stop the Tears. You look a lot like mother she said I always thought \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
other was the most beautiful person in the world but you might be just as pretty when you grow up she said to Addie. They leaned back in the cramped space with their backs against the wall and there heads almost touching the low ceiling which crowded down
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 on them from atop the third bunk.\line \line Well Addie said smiling faintly I think you and Susan are both very beautiful and kind like mother.\line \line 
We're gonna get you out of here she whispered.\line \line I miss\line \line What do they feed you in this place Elsie asked her motherly in\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 tincts coming out.\line \line 
Mostly stale bread and water that tastes far to much like minerals. Sometimes some wilted vegetables.\line \line Oh Elsie Addie burst out I wish you could stay. She higher her sister tighter.\line \line Don't give up hope Elsie said. She knew they were be
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ng watched and didn't want to give anything away but she knew Addie needed something to hold into. She leaned close and whispered ever so quietly in Addie's ear "soon".\line \line 
Addie have her a strong smile.\line \line She knew Addie was fragile an the hopeless months had\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 been hard\~ in her.\line \line So what happened to father Elsie said?\line \line 
Well it was terrible Addie replied.\line \line You don't have to talk about it if you don want to Addie said.\line \line No it's ok and seeing you gives me hope we can find him.\line \line We all got home and couldn't find yo
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
. Father was growing increasingly worried as the minutes stretched on. We searched the whole house over and over. Susan was terrified you should have seen her we had to stop for a few minutes for father to calm her. She was sobbing and couldn't catch her 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 reath, it makes me ache inside just to remember. Elsie hugged her closer as she went on.\line \line 
Father asked me to stay with Susan in case you came back then hurried out and saddled shadow he said he was going to the cairns but he never came back oh it was terr\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ble Addie sobbed.\line 
\line Susan and I sat holding each other waiting, waiting the world felt desolate and empty. Every minute hoping you and father would show uo. Some how eventually the sun rose as dawn spread its pale cold light over the world.\line \line We didnt know 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hat to do so we went down to the police station. There was a Massive search but nothing turned up.\line \line \line They came and took us away.\line \line \line 
Well I'm here now Elsie smiled and were gonna all be together soon, you me father Susan. I'm sure Susan will become insuffer\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ble with out me teasing her and keeping her in line she teased.
\line \line Addie smiled.\line \line Oh Elsie she said I keep remembering all the nice times we used to have. I feel like I'm too young to reminisce she smiled. Yes Elsie said I guess it's ok though it's portably\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 just easier for you.\line \line Addie giggled.\line \line I miss the seasons, well celebrating them with everyone father tilling the fresh soil in the spring\line \line \line \line 
The thing is they found her ring, her wedding ring or at least one very similar to it her and fathers initials are\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 engraved in it.\line \line Oh wherever did they find it Addie exclaimed!\line 
\line \~Well that's the Curious part some scholars found it in Antarctica\line \line Antarctica?\line \line I don't understand Addie replied\line \line \line CHAPTER\line \line \line \line We know about the dark creatures following you were trying to ke

\line Oh yes Elsie said and then the fall my favorite season of them all the brilliant \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 eaves gathering in the harvest pumpkins and\~ apple cider.\line \line 
Yes and then the winter the cozy evenings by the fire sledding and romping through the white snow covered hills, I do wish we got more snow in England.\line \line The world really can be a beautiful place.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Yes, when you have those you love beside you Elsie said.\line \line And we're going to get them back she said firmly.\line \line I don't want to give you false hope but James told me something curious. You know how I\~
 disappeared but was fine? Well she paused well he thinks \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hat we should try to find mother.\line \line Oh Elsie! You mean it?! Addie exclaimed her\~ eyes shining bright with hope.\line \line

The two worlds are tearing apart but they are bound together the dark matter between the two works like a form of gravity. The\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
danger is that we fear the pull is forcing the earth out of its orbit and towards the sun we also fear that it is not an accident but is an intentional act to destroy this world.\line \line Who would do that Elsie whispered.\line 
Who? Whom? what? We're not sure we think\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
it may be a dark entity that was banished from this works ages ago. A god if you will, but that being set up this tragedy and we fear others are continuing it.\line \line 
Why would they do that? Well we think they feel they are helping they want to let out those be\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ng imprisoned eons ago in the depths of time.\line \line \line \line \line 
They think there doing good to save the world from expiation.\line \line She felt they were sailing through space and time the air felt strangely charged. Everyone was quiet lost in there own thoughts.\line \line \line CHAPTER\line He 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ulled out a curious looking case with a look of reverence written across his aged face. Elsie looked nervously over at the professor, he too sat enraptured.\line \line 
Professor smith sat quietly staring at the curious and ancient box. It was covered in strange run\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s and heliographs. There also appeared to be some sort of ancient writing on it. The wood was dark and aged looking.\line \line 
It could have been her imagination but Elsie felt a strange sense of electricity in the room. She also felt drawn to touch the box but al\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
o terrified at the idea of touching it. The box seemed to fill the whole room and she couldn't take her wyes away from it.\~ Something inside her was being strongly drawn to the box.\line 
She wasn't sure how long she sat gazing at the box and it quickly had fil\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed her mind, everything else seemed to have vanished from her attention.\line \line 
It was in this reverie that She felt a gentle hand on her arm and realized she was leaning out towards it, about to touch it, professor smith was gently but firmly holding her back,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
please forgive me he said it does have a curious draw and I am not totally convinced of its safety.\line \line 
Elsie sat back red faced and embarrassed by her impudence. I'm sorry she said I really am that was rude of me, she couldn't believe she had almost touched\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 such a rare and valuable artifact.
\line \line Don't mention it he said with a smile. I know you meant no harm and I don't show the case often; and anyways you helped confirm what I already suspected.\line \line What do you suspect the professor asked,\line \line well many things but t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e one to which i was just referring had to do with the draw the artifact and its contents have on people, some individuals seem to be more drawn to it then others but everyone seems to be pulled in by it also the pull seems to increase the longer your aro
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nd it.\line \line I spend time researching it but feel that it May be risky to engage in prolonged research that involves directly handling or viewing the item.\line \~
Do you think it's dangerous Elsie said?\line \line I do he said but not for short periods of time. I still run ex\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
eriments on it about an hour a week and I usually have one of my students keeping on eye on things.\line \line Have you found out anything curious the professor asked?\line \line 
Sadly I don't feel that I have found anything conclusive. It's not radioactive during one experi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ent we thought that we had potentially detected a gamma with around a 663 Kev energy deposition. We thought that night be a cesium isotope which emits at 662 Kev but the next times we ran the experiment\line Nothing turned up.\line \line 
but I think that be\line \line \~physical c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ntact greatly increases the draw. I think that's the\~ the ms\~ may have negative effects on the mind. Unfortunately my sample size is one, me.\line 
\line Smith went on, For that reason I never handle it with my bare hands. I did at first a number of times but it bur\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ed itself into my mind I couldn't stop dreaming and thinking about it. I would wake in a cold sweat strange visions haunting the fringes of my memory.\~ It began to worry me an I grew concerned I was losing my mind.\line 
And it's not just the box but the writin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  and the contents of the box that seemed to cause these strange effects.\line \line 
It is a good thing I was teaching that term I missed there straight lecture and one of my graduate students found me almost past out clutching the box. He said I was muttering somet\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ing in a strange language. I asked him what it was and he said he didn't write it down he called the paramedics. Grad students these days are rather worthless, didnt wrote down what I was saying bah.\line 
Smith covered the box and leaned back in his chair and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 miled. Of course the other scholars all screamed it was a ridiculous hoax.\line \line 
Ok I asked them then can I let some undergraduate students come in and touch it as part of an experiment.\line \line Preposterous the administrators in their\line \line \line You didn't mention this befor\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  the professor said, everyone said it had been a medical condition.\line \line 
Well yes I'm sorry for misleading you regrettable but necessary smith and really if you think about it did I mislead anyone? Should I tell the dean my condition arises from a curious box\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ?\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 And if you believe that i mislead you that would mean you believe this box was capable of something extraordinary, magical in fact. Do you believe that?\line \line 
Hmm yes I see your point the professor replied it is a bit far fetched. So what do you believe this \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ox is?\line \line 
Hmm well I don't like to talk about it, I am rather enjoying my tenure and wouldn't my stayin around as an emeritus but I don't think they would keep a lunatic or a scientific fraud about the place.\line \line I do believe it is otherworldly.\line \line 
I understand \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 aid the professor. How did the box come into your possession?\line \line Ah yes it was an expedition to the Artic, we were studying diatoms,\~
 of course I'm a physicist turned archaeologist so diatoms are not of particular importance to my research the expedition wa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  mostly biologists and one chemist interested in the composition\~
 of ice cores.\line \line Why did you choose to go james asked?\line \line It was a manuscript that I had the fortune of analyzing I think the two are related, can we see it james cut in.\line In his excitement he a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ways became blunt but his glowing face and eager manner made it impossible to be offended by him, he clearly meant no harm his brain just lost touch with social graces.\line \line And what do other scholars say?\line A hoax.
\line What about the effects?\line A placebo.\line \line \line They hav\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 been researching the area for quite some time all the way back to the ill fated Langford expedition, this was thirty years ago mind you and the failure to turn up anything afterword left everyone deeply disappointed. Though I must say the subsequent expe
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 itions were not without scientific merit.\line \line What happened Elsie said feeling herself strangely drawn into the story.\line \line 
Right well ill just start from the beginning And trace out the whole story. The expedition sailed for South America In June, and mind you \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
his was thirty years ago. They reached the port city of.\line \line \line \line \line CHAPTER\line Elsie reached our slowly and took hold of the locket. She held the delicate gold piece gently in her hand as a wave of emotion washed over her.\line \line 
She struggled to hold back the Tears as t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e memories came back of the locket around her mothers slender neck and her blond hair spilled around it. The sense of security and love she felt when mother held her close and she felt nothing could ever hurt her and nothing could ever go wrong.\line 
\line She felt\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a gentle hand on hers and looked up to see Susan her eyes were very moist and she reached over and clutched her sister tightly.\line \line I miss her so much she whispered.\line 
\line Me too Susan said.\line \line Elsie didn't look up but they way her voice shook she knew she was cryi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g too.\line \line Ehh hmm\line \line 
Byzantine gently cleared his throat. Girls I don't want to give you false hope but there is a resin we showed this too you.\line \line \line \line \line \line CHAPTER\line Scholars fairly skel\line Artic expedition find one trapped in ice\line \line 
Elsie felt nervous and excited in the \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
redawn glow of the chilly morning. The airfield was bustling as last minute preparations were made for the dangerous artic expedition. Elsie pulled her hood tighter feeling pale and self conscious she hadnt had time to properly do her hair. And not gettin
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  enough sleep always made her feel pale. She looked at herself in the mirror that morning and thought I need to get out in the sun more often.\line \line 
Susan came in looking beautiful and wide awake like she was going to a fancy wedding, Elsie rolled her eyes and\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 tried to think of something smart to say but couldn't she was far too tired.
\line \line She quickly got over it as she watched all the excited energy and bustling of the expedition about to leave.\line \line Addie stumbled sleepily into the hangar, she looked like a beautifu\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  pale ghost hidden beneath her great overcoat.\line \line Hi addie Elsie said did you get breakfast.\line \line Oh I don't feel hungry quite yet Addie replied.\line \line 
Some of the expedition leaders wrte talking they all looked brave and strong. They were mostly from Oxford and edi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 gvrugh university.\line \line \line 
A young dashing looking gentleman came over he was tall and skinny but muscular and had the look of an English gentleman. He moved with careless ease and was smartly dressed and looked wealthy. He also looked cold and haughty as he fo

Lord Byron spoke in a thick English accent and moved with athletic and careless ease. Ladies do glad you could make it he shook\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 there hands all warmly and beamed a wide dashing smile at them.
\line \line Elsie felt a little nervous hello she said my name is Elsie nice to meet you. Elsie though maybe he was nicer then she imagined he seemed very friendly and his smile made him seem much more \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a

Lord Byron someone called, got to run I'm sure will be fast friends soon will be spending a lot of time together.\line \line So,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Elsie said your a lord? That does sound rather fancy its a shame your nit a night sir Byron has a nice ring to it.\line \line Elsie Susan said he is a knight he was\~ knighted last year the prof told me.\line \line 
Titles are meaningless he joked. They all boarded the airship\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
and were soon off soaring above the English Channel. Lord Byron came over with some scones and milk any one hungry he asked cheerfully.\line \line I am Elsie said what about you she asked Addie?\line \line 
Oh yes please I'm very hungry now. These are delicious Susan exclaime\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  so fresh.\line \line 
Yes I picked them up this morning from my favorite bakery, unfortunately we won't have that conscience for long.\line \line A slim and beautiful lady waked in. She looked elegant and delicate\~ as soon as she noticed them she quickly turned and left.

What Elsie blurted out how could anyone not want to talk to you! She was really starting to like the English gentleman\line \line Well give it a few days he joked I'm sure you'l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 be quite sick of me.\line \line I do have quite a bit of energy, I was quite the terror as a youngster My parents didn't know what to do with me.\line \line 
Where are the professor joked. When did this change. I heard about the recent prank you pulled. You really Are quite \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he ringleader when it comes to making trouble.\line \~
That is true he laughed, my father was glad ill be up in the artic, Byron stood up doing his best to look stuffy and dignified.\line \line The artic. What the dither are you doing in the artic.\line He stood with his arms \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 olded behind his back.\line \line 
Well he went on imitating his father At least you'll find it difficult to cause trouble up there nothing but snow and blasted ice. I don't know why you won't be reasonable and settle into banking like your older brothers.\line \line The prof
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ssor laughed that is a good impression of your father.\line \line The girls all laughed too though they didnt know his father they could imagine a dignified English\~ banker.\line \line 
The funny thing is, he went on in his normal voice.\line \line My grandfather was quite the rouge an\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 adventurer. He made out fortune but in his youth he was in and out of prison, lost his temper at a commanding officer and, plunk picked him up and tossed him into the sea.\line He was dishonorably discharged and ended up in a military prison.\line \line 
I love him thou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h he wasn't a bad sort or a criminal just fiery and full of pasison. My mother says I take after him, but I have yet to end up in prison and I hope to keep it that way.\line 
\line It was a nice night for sailing, the dead were calm and it was a surprisingly warm ni\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ht, they sat on the deck bundled in blankets and sweaters Talking and drinking warm cocoa and tea. The professor came out with a plate of warm cookies and freshly cut apples.\line \line Anna backed these he said for us he said.\line \line 
Is she coming out? Lord Byron asked \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 erhaps a little too quickly no one caught it but susan who cast a knowing glance at Elsie who was too busy with her own love interest, the\line 
Plate of cookies.\line \line Oh my those do look delicious she said.\line \line No james said she said she had some reading to do and wa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  going back to her bunk.\line \line 
Ah righto Byron said trying to hide his discouragement those do smell delicious your quite right.\line \line Well if you all going to be polite I'm gonna help mylsekf Elsie said grabbing one with a smile.\line \line Everyone else took one too. Oh my
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 these are delicious Elsie said.\line \line I quite agree Susan said. What do you think Addie Susan said.\line \line 
Good Addie said with a smile. Elsie knew she would say more if there were less people around.\line \line I could see why being a professor would be nice Susan said. Goin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 on cruises summers off not worries.\line \line Oh hold up a minute james laughed. You might not be paid for the summer but that doesn't mean you won't be working a lot or faculty want a 11 month appointment.\line \line \line 
Yes and don't forget those frayed students sleeping in\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 your class and forgetting thier homework Benjamin said with a sigh.\line \line \line And piles of data\line \line Mountains of data\line 
\line And trying to get tenure said Jonas the youngest member who was still only a year into his post doc.\line \line I wouldn't change it for the world though Jam\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s said.\line \line 
Me neither they all quickly agreed.\line \line What's that Addie said she pointed to the night sky where a strange blue light was glowing in the distance.\line \line \line \line \line \line They think there doing good to save the world from expiation.
\line \line She felt they were sailing throug\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  space and time the air felt strangely charged. Everyone was quiet lost in there own thoughts\line \line 
The girls snuggled into their bunks. The seas were relatively calm and peaceful. As Elsie came in from brushing her teeth Addie was already curled up covered in\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 blankets.\line \line 
Oh you look cozy Elsie said Addie smiled at her I am and the blankets are perfect it does get cold up in the artic.\line \line Well I don't think we're to the artic yet I imagine its going to get much colder.\line \line 
Susan walked in hi su Elsie said. Hello Susa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  said as she flopped down on Addie's bed. You sure look comfortable Susan smiled.\line \line 
We were just talking about that Elsie said when we are camping out on the ice it's going to get very cold.\line \line I know I'm a little worrie Susan said but I am glad we wi be wit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 such seasoned explorers.\line \line Oh guess what Addie said poking her face out from under her covers. Her blond hair was wild and beautiful.\line \line I talked to Anna I helped her back the cookies.\line \line What! Susan and Elsie both exclaimed.
\line \line What's she like\line \line Is she nice\line \line Sh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  hasn't said one word the whole trip.\line \line Ya I thought she was a snob who thinks shes to smart for everyone else.\line 
\line I went to Harvard Elsie said drawing out her words and trying to look conceited.\line \line Yes Susan said she thinks she is too good for lord Byron.\line \line An\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 I don't think you can find anyone more handsome them him.\line \line Except for father Elsie put in.\line \line Yes that's true Susan chimed in.\line \line No she is really nice Addie said I think she is shy.\line \line 
How did you meet her Elsie asked. Ell I went I to the Kitchen to get a sna\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k and she was starting I back them.\line \line 
We didnt say anything at first then she said that she thought I was lucky to have two older sisters. She said she was an only child and her parents were both old when she was born and she was raised by her grandma.\line \line No
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  I want to talk I get Elsie said I wonder if she is still awake.\line \line When I walked by her room it looked like her light was still in susan said.\line \line 
Well that settled it elsie said jumping out of bed.\line \line Come on Addie she said as she went over to her little siste\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Ok let me out on a sweater I'm cold. Addie grabbed a sweater and Elsie and Susan did too. As the ship sailed further towards the artic the nights were becoming increasingly chillier.\line \line Ok everyone ready susan said.\line \line 
Well maybe we shouldn't Elsie replied\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 suddenly feeling shy.\line \line Will be fine Susan said.\line \line 
Maybe we could bring her something Elsie mused that way it's no like we're just barging in.\line \line Something like what, a pony Susan said with a faint smile she tried to hide.\line \line Elsie rolled her eyes yes lets bein
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  her a pony I'm sure there all out grazing on the upper deck.\line \line I was thinking more along the lines of a nice snack.\line \line 
I would love some warm cocoa with whip cream Addie said.\line \line They patterned out into the ships narrow halls as they made their way Aup to the\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 galley.\line \line 
It sure is quiet in here tonight elsie said everybody must be upstairs riding the ponies.\line \line It's not called the upstairs on a ship susan said.\line \line 
Elsie rolled her eyes again then went on mischievously all I know is were in the basement and we need t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  go upstairs to the kitchen.\line \line Susan ignore her come on let's go.!\line \line 
Elsie knocked timidly on the door she wasn't feeling so bold anymore.\line \line Come in a pretty voice said from the other side of the door.\line \line Elsie timidly opened the door I hope we didnt wake you?\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Oh know she laughed im a night owl.\line \line Then she added quickly who is we?\line \line Oh Elsie said just me and my two sisters.\line \line Oh come in come in anna stood up and opene the door. Hi Addie she said warmly.\line \line 
We brought you some coca Addie said.\line \line Oh you girls are too \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 weet she said.\line \line 
Elsie and everyone sat at the ships rails staring out at the frozen artic town. People live here she asked incedullouslly?\line \line Yes professor james replied. They get around with sleds but it is a very remote village the island can only be reac
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed by ships. But even though it's remote it's a fairly large little city and there are some fun shops we can visit.\line \line 
As you can see its a fairly busy port for gold miners adventures and cargo ships.\line \line Elsie felt a little nervous about getting off with all \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hose rough people who might be living there. She realized the ship was starting to feel a little like home with their cost little bedroom.\line \line 
At that moment Addie came up on deck looking like a little blond Eskimo with her thick fur coat surrounding her fac\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  like a mane.\line \line 
Hi Addie Elsie said. Addie smiled Back what a strange city that is. Where are we?\line \line Susan said I'm not sure but somewhere getting closer to the artic.\line \line \line 
Ya and I think we are going to go ashore soon Elsie said. Some of the crew were working \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o ready the bit as it approached the rustic looking harbor.\line \line 
Lord Byron came over looking dashing and adventurous. Wanna go ashore and look around be asked?\line \line Yes the girls all exclaimed. Well that's not particularly true Susan looked a little unsure, It i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  safe she asked a little timidly.\line \line 
Oh of course he laughed. Well I suppose it can get a little rough but wi be fine he smiled. They climbed aboard the smaller boat and two of the crew rowed them to to dock. They then climbed up the ladder to the large and\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
aged wooden peor. The city spread out before them wooden bushes and shops that sheltered in the small valley. Steep mountains covered in pine and fir forest towered around the little port town. Higher up the trees were wreathed in clouds and mist that ros
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  to the gray skyline. Quite a site Elsie said taking it all in as they stood atop the pier they turned and looked ou\~ at the sheltered bay full of ships and boats.\line \line 
I can't believe anyone lives here Susan responded it seems so remote but it is very pretty\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 so rugged.\line \line 
Yes I think there is some charm for some people in being Away from things, the pioneer spirit as the Yankees would say. I find it a bit appealing but i think ok more of an expeditionary person, it's nice to get out in the solitude but it also 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 eels good to get back.\line \line So and you should see it in the winter lord Byron said. They get a lot of snow here.\~
 And it's very isolated also for a couple months it's dark all year round.\line \line Oh I don't know if I'd like that much dark Elsie said.\line \line Yes but they a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
so get about a month of sun.\line \line Well at the sake of sounding difficult I'm not sure id like that either Elsie laughed.\line \line 
I agree Byron said its fun to experience though. We're going have some long dark nights before were safely on the other side of our adven\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ure. And even if you prepare dr it it's still a bit rough. Good companions are critical to keeping your spirits up.\line \line They headed off the dock and into the interesting town. It reminded Elsie of a fort somewhat with it's remote location.\line 
\line It was fun lookin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  at all the strange buildings and shops and adventurous looking people.\line \line There is actually\~
 a really delicious restaurant here that we can go to when we get hungry.\line \line I hope that's soon laughed Elsie I should have eaten more breakfast Byron pulled out his \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
atch well it is 1 already definitely lunch time. Who else is hungry?\line \line I am both Susan and Addie jumped in. Well that makes four of ya said Byron it's off to lunch!\line \line 
They made there way up a street that wound up the hill. They shops were surprisingly well \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ept up be brightly panted\line \line It's pretty nice here susan said.\line \line 
Ya I'm. Little less worried about food poisoning now Elsie laughed.\line \line You'll love this place Byron said trust me he smiled.\line \line Then he tried to nonchablty say so when you asked anna to come what d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d she say.\line \line Susan gave Elsie a quick sly smile.\line \line Then said she had some reading to finish to finish and said she would come later.\line \line Quite right.\line \line 
Ah did she say would want to meet us , I oh don't want her to feel left out.\line \line She didnt say Elsie said feelin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a bit bad.\line \line 
Well no matter Byron said Elsie thought it seemed like he was trying to seem cheerful but she couldn't tell.\line \line The best minute he was back to his normal self as he began to describe the food choices they had. There stew is amazing especially o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a cold artic day like today.\line \line Oh that sounds delicious Susan said so they have good bread?\line \line 
Oh yes Byron said enthusiastically the best all made fresh. They reached the place it was warm and inciting. They sat at a nice booth in the back.\line \line They ordered t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e stew and fresh warmed bread for everyone.\line \~After the meal they went looking at some of the other shops on the street, they were full of all kinda of interesting things.\line \line 
Addie found a small beautiful telescope that she couldn't put down, look at this El\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ie she said.\line \line Susan and Elsie crowded around oh that is wonderful. It's a shame it's so expensive.
\line \line Yes Addie sighed I think I'm gonna save up and get one.\line \line You'll have to save you allowance for Elsie scrunched her face trying to concentrate two and a hal\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  years.\line 
I think it would be worth it Addie said.\line We could look at the stars. There so lovely and far away.\line \line I know Elsie said I've always loved the idea of them.\line I think I'm gonna try to save up and get one Addie said thoughtfully.\line \line 
Talking about there al\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 owance made them all realize they missed there father. I hope we find father soon. Me too Susan said.\line \line Think of how much fun it would be he gather were with us.
\line \line Elsie sighed. Will find him again I'm sure of it.\line \line Addie carefully set the telescope back and\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 they walked over to where Byron was browsing the apparel.\line \line 
I think I'm gonna buy this he said, holding up an enormously\~ ugly flannel shirt.\line \line Eww Elsie said without thinking.\line \line Elsie! Susan jumped in, mind your manners\line \line You don't like it Byron laughed here
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 '\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s the thing, he lowered his voice in a conspiratorial manner. Where were going there's not a lot of people or ladies but there is a lot of cold and this is just the type of thing I would want for that.\line \line He smiled broadly holding it up.\line 
\line What do you think \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e said holding it up to Susan. Well she said, it is rather, er lovel well it does look like it would keep you warm.\line \line Warm and single Elsie laughed.\line 
\line Even Susan tried to hold back a laugh.\line \line What about anna Elsie burst out with out thinking then clapped her\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hands over her mouth.\line \line Susan grabbed her Elsie you brat!
\line \line Addie tried to hide a giggle.\line \line That settled it Byron said I'm buying it for sure. Like I said no one I need to impress.\line \line They went up to the shopkeeper a rather burly women, oh my that is lovely sh
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  said.\line \line Thank you Byron said.\line \line They went out side and Byron said oh wait one second. He went back in the shop. And came out with a package. He handed it to Addie.\line 
\line What's this Addie asked her heart rising at the shape of the long circular package. P\line \line Open\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 it Byron beamed with joy.\line \line 
Oh no you don't have to buy us anything both Elsie and Susan exclaimed.\line \line We can share it! Addie said\line \line No no he laughed I got this lovely coat and Addie got something we all need a surprise besides I won't be able to buy anything
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 for mounts I gotta get it out if my system.\line \line Well that is very kind of you Elsie said.\line \line 
Great it's settled he said as he put on his new flannel coat. How's it look. He was so handsome and dashing he looked good in anything. Well Elsie said its a little be\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ter then I expected.
\line \line As Susan and Elsie went about the store exclaiming in joy he leaned over to Addie and whispered can you keep a secret\line \line Yes she said.\line \line 
Well I know it's really quite hideous, a monstrosity of fashion. Which is why I plan to wear it aro\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nd my father at all times especially at fancy events.\line \line 
Addie giggled I think I'm starting to like it.\line \line They might the girls talked\line \line Oh look at this Susan Elsie called from across the store holding up a beautiful globe. With this will never be lost again. \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 S
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 usan laughed yes and you could for it nicely in your back pocket.\line \line Hmm yes that's true Elsie said maybe I should look for something practical for the trip.\line \line 
Oh I know what I am going to get Susan said holding up a beautiful coat that looked both stylish a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d warm.\line \line

Oh yes he said in fact I insist.\line \line And now I say \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e should head to the markets\~ and load up on some fresh provisions and snacks.\line \line 
They all piled into their bunks for the evening,\~ well that was a fun day\~ Susan said. They were all sitting on Addie's bed curled up in their warm blankets and snacking on th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

She hurried lightly out the door and down the hall padding with her bare feet on the cold ships floor. I should have grabbed my slippers she thought to herself. She was quickly at Anna's door and the might was on. She knoc\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed quietly.\line \line Come in her soft and beautiful voice rang out.\line \line 
Hello Elsie said shyly she still wasn't totally comfortable around anna, she seemed so stylish and quiet and intelligent. But she felt of she got to know her, maybe she had misjudged her. She se\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 med so kind the last time they had spoken.\line \line Elsie gathered her courage,\~ do you like candy? We got some in the town and wanted to share it with you do you wanna come down to our cabin?\line

This isn\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 '\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t on any of the maps Anna said. This is just supposed to be ice and ocean but look how green and rugged a everything is.\line \line It looks like a another world Elsie whispered.\line 
\line Yes I've never seen anything like it Susan said.\line \line Are we going to land there Elsie as\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed.\line \line Yes yes we have to james said.\line \line 
The ocean became treble lent and the waves choppy.\line \line Some people get caught between the two worlds and disappear for a whole and some forever.\line \line Big attack on city\line \line Sanctuary where connect\line \line 
Why would they do that Elsie w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ispered.\line \line \line Chapter 5\line 
She was nervous as they drove up the bumpy dirt road to mr potters house. It was a nice night even though it had been quite hot that day, uncomfortably warm in fact the kind of late fall day where the summer tries to flex it's muscles
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
a few last times afraid of being forgotten as the months (days slowly) fade to winter. Now it was cooling off, the sky was mostly blue but scattered clouds were drifting in from the west she stared as the setting sun set them to brilliant shades of pastel
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  pinks and whites.\line \line I wish we were going to a wedding she broke the silence with.\line \line A wedding he replied?\line \line 
Yes with lanterns hanging from the trees and dancing late into the night. And everyone would comment why miss Elsie what a fancy car your arriving in,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 and I would reply thank you very much it belongs to my chauffeur mr professor.\line \line The professor laughed you can call me by my last name or first name if you would like\line \line 
Ok she said, and this is my chauffeur mr Charles she joked using his last name.\line \line Yes we\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
dings are lovely he said quite lovely i also like graduations I like to see all the students in their fine robes and all the lovely family's so proud and happy and everyone dressed up.\line \line Oh yes\~
 , Elsie said and the best part of weddings and graduations th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  punch and the cake! I think I love sparkling raspberry punch the most.\line \line 
Elsie paused suddenly serious again I do hope everything goes ok, he's not, not dangerous is he?\line \line No, no I don't think so, i hope not, strange, cracked, sad eccentric but dangerous n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\~
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  all though I haven't seen him in quite sometime in fact maybe you better wait in the car he said.\line \line Oh no your not leaving me out of the action! she responded\line \line 
Ok well all the same I do hope we get there soon id rather we speak to him while it's still li\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ht out\line \line Why is that she said?\line \line 
Well mostly because the night can play games on us and our fears can make us see what isn't there.\line \line All the same, oh would you look at that here is our turn. He slowed abruptly and turned up an overgrown looking lane dense o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 both sides with trees and bushes and thick undergrowth. At one point they passed what looked like the remains of an overgrown garden. It looked sad and lonely in fact the whole area had a forlorn and forgotten feel to it.\line \line 
Elsie peered out the window as \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hey bumped up the road it felt like they were leaving civilization all together.\line A wild forest began to grow around them and\~ after about 15 minutes\~
 of climbing and bumping up the road it opened up to a meadow with a worn out looking house. Overgrown bla\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 kberry bushes grew all over one side and the whole place had an air of disrepair.
\line \line Elsie reConsidered the offer to stay in the car.\line \line Well the professor said, doesn't look to promising now does it?\line \line No Elsie said and the dusk is creeping upon us fast I hop\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  he is quite sane. She doubted anyone sane would live by themselves in the old house they had arrived at.\line \line 
The professor opened the car door and Elsie heard the crunch of gravel as he stepped out into the rocky driveway.\line Elsie opened her door and together\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
they walked with trepid steps up to the house. A cool evening breeze blew around them as They ascended the rickety stairs to the yellowish house with its faded and peeling paint, at the top they both stopped.\line \line 
Ohh my the professor said, look at the view,\line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 E\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
lsie turned and over the tops of the woods saw the great ocean stretched out before them. It's beautiful she whispered, just think what wild lands lay out there so far away.\line \line Yes the professor replied\line \line 
They stared quietly at the view the setting sun lit t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e ocean and hung glowing orange setting both the sky and ocean alight with shades of orange reflecting and\line \line 
You know Elsie said, I always wanted to have an adventure but I pictured it quite different then this.\line \line Yes the professor agreed a wise author once\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 said that\line \line 
Yes and i suppose being locked up is hardly an adventure but right now I'm nervous and I'm scared but theirs also beauty.\line \line \line 
They sat in silence as the sun touched its feet slowly into the great ocean. It seemed to shake them both out of their r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
verie as they turned slowly on the creaky front porch. The professor knocked on the door, once twice, three times and waited. No response.\line \line Nothing\line Silence\line \line The professor tried again, this time louder\~ but still no reply.\line \~
They waited and waited it felt l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ke an eternity,\line \line \line Well i suppose ill give it one more go, we may have wasted a trip up here.\line \line 
Elsie felt relieved but also faintly disappointed she wanted to meet the man who shared such a similar experience but was also afraid of what she might learn.\line \line T\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e professor knocked loudly for the last time and they both waited.\line \line Well the professor started then they heard a cranky muffled voice, I'm coming!"\line \line \~The rusty door handle turned and the door opened slowly to a dark interior.\~
 An aged man slowly opened th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  door his movements were slow and fit his aged appearance.\line \line "Mr potter!" she exclaimed in a whisper\line \line 
Well I see you know me at any rate though I don't know you he said gruffly.\line \line She barely noticed his gruff manner what she did notice were his eyes,\line Alive \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
right piercing even beautiful all the more shocking given the wrinkled skin and decrepit appearance of the man before them. He was dressed in an outdated\~ black suit and had a old rifle in his hand.\line \line 
Elsie hung nervously back behind the professor she had \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rabbed ahold of his coat without even realizing it as she tore her eyes away from his gaze she noticed how decrepit and ran down the place was.\line He was still clutching his rifle, begone He said in a heavy English\~
 accent ill call the constable this is priv\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 te property. His voice sounded tired and aged.\line \line You know him the professor said?\line \line \line 
But James the professor said don't you recognize me?\line \line Ehh he said taking off his glasses, why if it isn't Charles the rumors running out, need to come up here and stir up s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 me more?
\line \line No no nothing of the sort james I never meant you anything but happiness and I've always tried to believe you, even when I feel you had lost faith in your self.\line \line 
James stood staring at them, oh i recognize you your that Simmons girl aren't you?\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Yes sir Elsie replied still clutching the professors suit coat.\line \line Your sister\~
 doesn't seem to think much of me she scare easy?\line He broke into a harsh laugh that sounded quite insane.\line \line Well Elsie said pausing for time as she tried to decide how to go on wit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 out offending him. Susan can be bit shy around her elders she said.\line \line 
James, the professor broke in with (a calm authority in his voice) more authority then she had ever heard from him. The girls been through a lot her and her whole family, in fact that's \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he reason for this whole visit.\line \line James stared at them intensely with his bright piercing eyes.\line \line I'm sorry but I don't want to talk and now if youll excise me, bang! He slammed the door.\line \line 
Well I think that went rather well the professor said with a slight \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 int of sarcasm.\line \line 
James he called aloud, I know your a good man and not time or loneliness could ever take that from you. This girls lost her family and been through a lot and If there is any decency left in you you'll give us a few minutes of your time an
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  will be in our way.\line \line They waited. The door slowly turned on its rusty hinges, well blast it come in he said.\line \line Chapter 6\line 
I suppose you'll be wanting tea he said gruffly?\line \line Elsie shared a quick look with the professor that seemed to agree that they wouldn't\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
want any food or drink that he would have in this old place.\line \line 
They walked out of the parlor through a dim dark and dirty hall. The carpet was old and brown and dirty and the walls were grimy with dirt and use. She could only imagine how dirty and decrepit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 the place would look if there was more light but there wasn't it was just dark and dismal.\line \line 
They got to the back of the house (which was quite large) and sat down at a small dirty farmhouse table. There were two windows that were grimy with what looked li\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e years of\line 
Dirt and filth. The curtains were pulled shut and with the setting sun their was very little light.\line \line I'm not sure i want any of his tea Elsie whispered to the professor the second he was gone.\line \line 
I don't blame you the professor said ill se what I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 can do if anything just leave the tea cup in front of you, I feel like he would be offended easily.\line \line 
He sure is a strange one Elsie whispered back,\line \line Dont worry the professor replied seeming to grasp the deeper meaning and fear in her whisper. You two are \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 q\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
uite different he said. But inside the professor felt Aa slight twinge of doubt. He saw more alike in the two then different both bright, attractive and likable. He vowed to himself to do everything in his power two keep Elsie from ending up like James; a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d if possible to help james recover some of the life and promise that had slipped away from him leaving him isolated and forever alone. Tormented and alone.\line \~
As he was thinking these thoughts\line He tottered back in with three cups\line \line He sat down wearily. Well \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 suppose I should tell you the full truth, I'm afraid you won't find it nearly as adventurous or engaging as the long years have made it seem, or for that matter my own embellishments.\line \line 
I've made some mistakes, he began slowly while playing with the handl\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  on his tea cup; spinning it one way the slowly turning it back on the small saucer.\line \~
I often think about what drive me to them. I think that the root of it was that I always wanted attention, my father was a hard man and he drove me relentlessly when I w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s young.\~
 I could never earn his approval I was just a piece of flotsam drifting about and underfoot. I never really felt like I fit in.\line But James Charles interrupted, you were always the most popular person growing up everyone adored you! Think of the fu
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  all of our friends the adventures we had. We were all so close.\line \~James paused for a while, "You can develop curious habits as a child that stay with you your whole life. "\line 
Anyways I have better things to do then talk to you to so ill hurry up my story an\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  then I'm afraid you need to leave.\line \~
At that moment Elsie heard a Strange tap on the window, she turned to look and also Noticed\~ an anxious look from James. She also noticed something else his movement was quick and rapid. She was surprised by his sudden\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 movement.\line \line He continued to stare out the window then carried on with his story it was obvious he was trying to act like nothing had happened.\line \line 
Like I said I was young and stupid and quite frankly tired of the military.\line I came up with a wild plan to disapp\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ar I felt like it would solve all my problems. I could get away from the military,\~ and I felt it would make my father and family realize they loved me and wanted me around.\line \line 
Would you like some more tea he said? Elsie realized with horror she had been dr\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
nking from one of his dirty cups. What was even stranger the tea was some of the best she had ever had She quickly thought well if I'm gonna get sick I mylse well have some more.\line \line 
He seemed to guess her thoughts it's from the orient he offered I have a co\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 lection from all over the world.\line \line Yes please that would be kind of you she said.\line \line 
She noticed the professor had been drinking his too.\line \line And I suppose you'll be wanting more to he said gruffly to James. But Elsie sensed a slight pleasure in his voice she t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ough maybe he was glad they liked his tea.\line \line Yes please James replied. If its not to much trouble.\line \line Of course it's too much trouble he replied again crankily but your here so I can't very well turn you out like a bunch of beggars.\line 
\line As James left the room s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e whispered, half joking were both Gonna die I bet he has never washed those cups.\line \line 
Yes Charles joked back but the tea is good I suppose their are worse ways to go though I would have preferred something a little more heroic myself but all and all it seem\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 rather fitting for an Englishman, or woman .\line \line So basically i set the whole thing up, I hadn't planned to but the opportunity presents itself in Egypt and in a Heath pounding moment that was both freeing and terrifying I slipped away.\line 
\line When you weren't pa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ing attention I snuck out the back I had a guide put a camel. I rode back to the city and caught a steamer for America. I sailed west and spent time gold mining, as you can see from my place I didn't have much luck he said wryly. I planned to come back af
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
er a year but I ran into some legal trouble and spent 9 Years in jail. I found out through some friends you planned to go back to visit the pyramids and decided to show up. It was all a big joke to me but my time in prison had been rough and I had grown j
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ded\~ I had 9 long Yeats in jail to make up my stories.\line \line \line But I was homesick, not they the states are a bad place\line Prof asks. Question and catches his lie\line \~
There are words for people like me and I'm still sane enough to know there not nice.\line \line Well that's the\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 whole truth and now if you'll excuse me I'm rather busy this evening.\line 
He stood up and walked them to the front door and out to their car. He hobbled on his came but made it down the steps then shuffled alongside them to their car.\line \line \line \line \line \line \line just a minute if y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u'll excuse me he said and please do stay put in the kitchen. Elsie noticed his face when he said this it appeared to be drawn with fear and strain. I didn't realize it had got so late and now if you'll excuse me.\line 
\line They went back through the dim and dirty\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hallway now almost black from the setting sun that had fled the world of the living.\line \line 
as Elsie stepped on the porch the first thing she noticed was how strange a night it was. It was dark and starless she realized the clouds must have rolled in. It didn't\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
feel like rain though the night felt brooding like it was watching her. As she stood there the feeling grew and she looked around nervously but didn't see anything just the dark shape of the solloiute of the pine trees rising tall agains the night sky.
\line \line E\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 x\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 treme\line \line they stood on\~
 the porch he had lot small he had lot small strange candles that traced a pathway to their car the candles were arranged in a circle around their car.\line \line Elsie gulped nervously maybe he is cracked she thought she glanced up nervously a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  James but his look seemed to say don't say anything.\line just ignore it will talk later.\line \line 
Now James went on please do stay inside your car until your back ok the main road. It's been a strange night.\line \line \line \line Elsie felt a thrill of terror run down her spine.\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 He hovered around them Elsie also noticed he was clutching something in his right hand and that he seemed rather tense.\line \line No one said anything as he walked with them.\line \line 
the professor opened Elsie's door for her and she settled into the nice comfortable ca\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r.\~\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 The car felt familiar and safe especially given the woods around the house which now seemed more foreboding in the dark.\line \line As Charles got in on the driver side\~ James said, i would stay in the car tell your long past the woods, and\~
 Charles I do hope yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  can forgive me? I never meant any harm to anyone I'm an d tried man who still hasn't seen the folly of his ways.\line \line 
James the professor responded I've always admirer you ever since we were kids and that hasn't changed, good night to you will be safe and I \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hink we will be in the car tell we get back to London, I don't particularly fancy a night stroll this evening.\line \line 
Right james responded, well Good evening to you both he said to them both and then, bang. The door closed abruptly and they were out of the col\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  chilly air. Safe and snug in the car.\line 
\line Once the doors were closed they started their bumpy trip down the dirt road. Elsie looked in the rear view mirror and saw him watching them from the porch. Then they rounded a sharp curve and the pine trees abruptly\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hid him from view.\line \line They were both silent with their thoughts both thinking through what has just occurred.\line \line Eventually the professor said, what did you make of all that?\line \line 
It was very strange Elsie said pensively. His talk about the woods and not getting \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ut made me a bit scared. Though everything is scary in a dark forest. When will we reach the main road? Elsie said trying to keep her voice steady. She knew she was being a bit silly but the long day and visit had left her a little jumpy.\line \line 
I think any min\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 te he responded\~ Ah yes here comes the turn up ahead now.\line \line 
When they were back on the main road and had picked up some speed Elsie brought up something that had been bothering her, Did you see how quickly he turned when their was that noise on the window?\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Yes I did the professor said.it was very strange it didn't fit his decrepit appearance, I also noticed something else\line \line What was that said Elsie?\line \line Well his left ear had no hair on it, I'm sure Susan would have been rather disappointed
\line \line Elsie laughed yes s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e is rather fond of ear hair.\line \line 
The laugh quickly turned to a sharp stab of homesickness she suddenly wanted to cry she missed her sisters and father and mother so much.\line \line The professor, who was always more perceptive then his absent minded mannerisms let o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  quickly said we are going to get them back\line \line 
Thank you Elsie said, they were quiet again until they had driven a ways, now they were passing quickly by the lights of a small village .\line Then something suddenly came back to her did you notice his eyes? So br\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ght so alive, they didnt match him either!\line \line 
Oh definitely they stood out to me the second he opened the door. they seem to be growing brighter and more piercing with age. No, i feel there is something more about James then he is letting on.\line \line I'd love to g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t the truth out of him. But it's hard i have a had a number of meetings with him over the last twenty years and he has always been very closed off, tonight was the most open he has ever been. Well since before he disappeared he was very open to me when we
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 were younger.\line \line 
They were back on the main highway and traveling at a good pace on the nice smooth pavement. Elsie leaned her head against the window and stared at the passing scenery her mind full of thoughts.\line \line Finally she brought up another question that
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 had been bothering her, I wonder what he is so afraid of?\line \line 
Yes the professor said it could very well be that his mind is slipping, there are a lot of signs that he is not quite right so some paranoia and delusions\~ would be a rather unsurprising outcome f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 om that.\line \line Elsie could tell something was going through the professors head.\line \line What are you thinking about she said?\line \line Well hmm,\~ well it's rather uncharacteristic\~
 of me I don't know if I should say he smiled a conspiratorial smile.\line \line Oh tell me Elsie said I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 won't judge.\line \line 
Ok well I used to be quite a huntsman back in my youth, only for.\line \line Your gonna shoot him! Elsie jumped in with.\line Oh no no good gracious no, is that what you think of me?\line \line 
Elsie laughed I was kidding but come on you did kinda set yourself up fo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  that.\line \line 
So the professor went on, what I was going to say was I was thinking of setting up a deer stand down at the edge of his driveway to see if I notice anything suspicious.\line \line 
I have some graduate students that would probably love a break from collectin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  algae blooms.\line \line 
That's a good idea Elsie said normally I wouldn't approve of spying but I feel this is a rather unique situation and I feel he is up to something too.\line \line Nothing for a solid week. He was about to give up when one of his grad students arthur 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ad some exciting news.\line \line 
Well arthur said I was sitting there eating some cold bangers and mash I don't recommend it. He said. Well the boredom was pretty bad I had a penny dreadful by it was a bit dul too. Well I see a great limousine pulling up the drive
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ay. I hopped on mu moped and waited.\line I followed them to the airport very carefully and watched the gentleman get out.\line What did he look like Elsie said?\line 
Oh a cranky old man too hat cane ya know the like.\line \line \line James sat hunched over he looked like a defeated m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n.\line \line 
Elsie felt a little sorry for him. He seemed both shy and reticent and rubbed his hands on his trousers in a nervous manner. While nervous his movements were swift and sure; not the movement of an elderly man.\line \line 
I do ask your forgiveness he said in a s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rong clear voice, strong And yet somehow faltering. What I intend to tell you is the total truth, the truth as I know it or at Least as I perceive it to be.\line 
I will be totally open i just ask for your understanding. I an to tell you everything I know and a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 so what I suspect. I will also fill you in on what i have learned.\line 
Like I said some of this is conjecture from my research.\line \line The first thing is my disappearance. No matter what I have said throughout the years is what I will say is the total truth accordi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
g to my perception of the events. The tome between when I disappeared and when I was found again seemed no more to me than at most a could hours. I remember clearly falling asleep and I thought that at most an hour had gone by. I remember thinking it was 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 trange that I had fallen asleep I had just sat down for no more then what I thought was a few minutes to rest my eyes.\line \line 
When I came back out and saw everyone I was still feeling a bit Groggy but totally clueless as to what had happened.\line \line I used to wonder \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
f I had imagined the whole thing. But things have happened since then that Leave no doubt that something did and is still happening,\line \line \~
That day I had no more recollection of time passing I thought an hour or two at most had gone by. I was shocked and terr\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
fied when the reality I had been missing ten years hit me. Not only that but I knew no one believed me. I began to question my own sanity. Where had I been that whole time? I still do question my sanity.\line \line 
Sitting in that military prison was one of the dar\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 est times of my life\line \line Elsie was surprised by how intensely he talked and by how young he looked at times.\line \line 
So all of that is true at least according to my own understanding. At the time I had no idea where I had been even know I don't fully know but I do \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ave some strong guesses.\line \line 
When I got out I felt my life was in shambles my father had been a military man himself, served in India and had risen to colonel before leaving to join the family business.\line \line The first thing I did when I got out of prison was to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
o back home but my family wanted nothing to do with me. I think my mother would have reconciled but my father believed me a coward and a disgrace, I was about to be deployed on a rather dangerous assignment and the rumors were that I was a coward. I've st
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ll got four white feathers sitting besides my bed; my life goal to get them taken back. But I've rather failed at that.\line 
He paused and sighed running his hands through his long hair. Elsie noticed the roots of his hair were dark black.\line \line She realized james \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ad come out of his stupor and caught her looking so she quickly looked away.\line \line 
I think that something, he paused searching for the right words, I think that something happened while I was away. I believe I may have slipped away from the chains of mortality.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
He paused with a far away look on his face\line \line I don't believe this chains anymore bind me. For how long I don't know but something has happened to me.\line \line 
Elsie took the moment to share a look with the professor that seemed to say, he's mad, quite mad.\line \line All \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he comments more alarming Elsie thought since he has moments of such clarity and sanity.\line \line The place that we would call Atlantis and their angry they believe that by severing the ties to our world\line \line Have you heard Cortez he went on?
\line \line James paused seeming to\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 be most in his own thoughts. Elsie looked out the window at the Oceanside in the distance.\line \line \line \line \hich\f0 Gil P\'e9\loch\f0 rez\line 
Have you heard of Perez? He said abruptly changing the subject.\line \line Noboth Elsie and the professor responded.\line \line Well it's a very curious story, a myth and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 legend but fairly well documented and very strange I've looked into it extensively and believe it to be the truth.\line \line He was a Spanish solider he slipped out of time and space oh and this was a while ago the 16th century.\~
 It started out as a normal evenin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  for Perez. It was the night of October 24, 1593 and he was guarding the Governor's palace in Manila .\line \line \hich\f0 
Something significant had happened the night before. The Governor G\'f3\loch\f0 \hich\f0 mez P\'e9\loch\f0 \hich\f0 rez Dasmari\'f1\loch\f0 as had been assassinated by Chinese pirates.\line \line Wait interjected El\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ie so then why were they guarding the palace?\line \line 
Oh James went on because it was still a government building and the soldiers and garrison would still function as normal well mostly normal I don't quite know how the soldiers felt of they were happy he was g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ne or mourning his loss but either way they still maintained military protocol. It was a major event but news traveled more slowly in the 16th century.\line \line Oh that makes sense Elsie said.\line \line 
Well Perez began feeling ill he became dizzy and exhausted he closed \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
is eyes to rest and when he opened them he had no idea where he was obviously he was panicked and he had potentially just deserted his post,\line \line That sounds familiar said the professor,\line \line 
Yes James said falling through time can have rather negative consequenc\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s on ones personal life.\line \line 
Well he was obviously disoriented and confused and was found by some guards on Mexico City who did not recognize his uniform. As they questioned him he frantically tried to make them understand he had been on the Philippines a fe
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  minutes ago.\line \line Well everyone was confused at first but eventually he was arrested for desertion of his post and he was also suspected of dark arts.\line \line 
He had told the soldiers and other people about the assassination of the governor which had happens the da\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 before so it was impossible he would have known and been able to travel that far by the next day. Naturally when news reached Mexico City everyone was shocked. Eventually he was freed and he faded into obscurity.\line \line 
What do you think that has to do with yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  or Elsie the professor asked.\line \line \line \line 
He was stationed in the Philippines and in the blink of an eye was transferred to the Plaza Mayor in Mexico City. Of course no one believed him or that he had come from the Philippines.\line \line He was\line \line \~they can recover what the
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  lost.\line \line \line Also Elsie burst in I didn't believe one word about his story I'm not sure what happened to him but I don't think he sailed to america.\line \line 
No the professor said and when I asked him about\line \line One other thing that stood out said the professor.\line I'm bit \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 uying one but of it, did you notice his left ear?\line \line \line 
Oh Addie she burst out into tears at how thin and gaunt her little sister looked. Her pretty face seemed to be lined with sadness and worry, but her face lit up as she threw herself on Elsie. Elsie hugge\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  her tightly back happy but worried about how thin and frail she felt. Elsie realized she was crying but that Her warm tears were tears of joy now at hugging her little sister again.\line \line 
They sat down on the cold hard bed, Elsie looked around the room which \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
as more like a prison an realized she had it better off then her younger sister. She pulled Addie tight and wrapped her arm around her delicate little shoulders as they both sat in happy silence at being reunited.\line \line \~
They sad you were dead Addie whispered \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 q\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 uietly as if even saying the words was too terrible.\line \line No Elsie said I'm not and Susan's not either.\line \line \line 
I love what you've done to the place Elsie joked sarcastically.\line \line What do they feed you in this place Elsie asked her motherly instincts coming out.\line \line Most\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
y stale bread and water that tastes far to much like minerals. Sometimes some wilted vegetables.\line \line Oh Elsie Addie burst out I wish you could stay. She higher her sister tighter.\line \line 
Don't give up hope Elsie said. She knew they were being watched and didn't wa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t to give anything away but she knew Addie needed something to hold into. She leaned close and whispered ever so quietly in Addie's ear "soon".\line \line Addie have her a strong smile.\line \line 
She knew Addie was fragile an the hopeless months had been hard\~ in her.\line \line So w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 at happened to father Elsie said?\line \line Well it was terrible Addie replied.\line \line 
You don't have to talk about it if you don want to Addie said.\line \line No it's ok and seeing you gives me hope we can find him.\line \line We all got home and couldn't find you. Father was growing inc\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
easingly worried as the minutes stretched on. We searched the whole house over and over. Susan was terrified you should have seen her we had to stop for a few minutes for father to calm her. She was sobbing and couldn't catch her breath, it makes me ache 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nside just to remember. Elsie hugged her closer as she went on.\line \line 
Father asked me to stay with Susan in case you came back then hurried out and saddled shadow he said he was going to the cairns but he never came back oh it was terrible Addie sobbed.\line \line Susan\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 and I sat holding each other waiting, waiting the world felt desolate and empty. Some how the sun rose as dawn spread its pale cold light over the world. Susan and I cried\~
 and cried we decided to go out looking to but couldn't find anything.\line \line in the morn\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ng We didnt know what to do so we went down to the police station. There was a Massive search but nothing turned up.\line \line CHAPTER\line \line \line CHAPTER\line \line 
The two worlds are tearing apart but they are bound together the dark matter between the two works like a form of grav\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ty. The danger is that we fear the pull is forcing the earth out of its orbit and towards the sun we also fear that it is not an accident but is an intentional act to destroy this world.\line \line Who would do that Elsie whispered.\line 
Who? Whom? what? We're not sure \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e think it may be a dark entity that was banished from this works ages ago. A god if you will, but that being set up this tragedy and we fear others are continuing it.\line \line 
Why would they do that? Well we think they feel they are helping they want to let out \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hose being imprisoned eons ago in the depths of time.\line \line \line \line \line 
They think there doing good to save the world from expiation.\line \line She felt they were sailing through space and time the air felt strangely charged. Everyone was quiet lost in there own thoughts.\line \line \line CHA\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 P
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 TER\line He pulled out a curious looking case with a look of reverence written across his aged face. Elsie looked nervously over at the professor, he too sat enraptured.\line \line 
Professor smith sat quietly staring at the curious and ancient box. It was covered in str\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
nge runes and heliographs. There also appeared to be some sort of ancient writing on it. The wood was dark and aged looking.\line \line 
It could have been her imagination but Elsie felt a strange sense of electricity in the room. She also felt drawn to touch the bo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 x\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 but also terrified at the idea of touching it. The box seemed to fill the whole room and she couldn't take her wyes away from it.\~ Something inside her was being strongly drawn to the box.\line 
She wasn't sure how long she sat gazing at the box and it quickly\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 had filled her mind, everything else seemed to have vanished from her attention.\line \line 
It was in this reverie that She felt a gentle hand on her arm and realized she was leaning out towards it, about to touch it, professor smith was gently holding her back, pl\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ase forgive me he said it does have a curious draw and I am not totally convinced of its safety.\line \line 
Elsie sat back red faced and embarrassed by her impudence. I'm sorry she said I really am that was rude of me, she couldn't believe she had almost touched su\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h a rare and valuable artifact.
\line \line Don't mention it he said with a smile. I know you meant no harm and I don't show the case often; and anyways you helped confirm what I already suspected.\line \line What do you suspect the professor asked,\line \line well many things but the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ne to which i was just referring had to do with the draw the artifact and its contents have on people, some individuals seem to be more drawn to it then others but everyone seems to be pulled in by it also the pull seems to increase the longer your around
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 it.\line \line I spend time researching it but feel that it May be risky to engage in prolonged research that involves directly handling or viewing the item.\line \~
Do you think it's dangerous Elsie said?\line \line I do he said but not for short periods of time. I still run exper\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ments on it about an hour a week and I usually have one of my students keeping on eye on things.\line \line Have you found out anything curious the professor asked?\line \line 
Sadly I don't feel that I have found anything conclusive. It's not radioactive during one experimen\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 we thought that we had potentially detected a gamma with around a 663 Kev energy deposition. We thought that night be a cesium isotope which emits at 662 Kev but the next times we ran the experiment\line Nothing turned up.\line \line but I think that be
\line \line \~physical cont\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ct greatly increases the draw. I think that's the\~ the ms\~ may have negative effects on the mind. Unfortunately my sample size is one, me.\line \line 
Smith went on, For that reason I never handle it with my bare hands. I did at first a number of times but it burned\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
itself into my mind I couldn't stop dreaming and thinking about it. I would wake in a cold sweat strange visions haunting the fringes of my memory.\~ It began to worry me an I grew concerned I was losing my mind.\line 
And it's not just the box but the writing a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d the contents of the box that seemed to cause these strange effects.\line \line 
It is a good thing I was teaching that term I missed there straight lecture and one of my graduate students found me almost past out clutching the box. He said I was muttering somethin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 in a strange language. I asked him what it was and he said he didn't write it down he called the paramedics. Grad students these days are rather worthless, didnt wrote down what I was saying bah.\line 
Smith covered the box and leaned back in his chair and smi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed. Of course the other scholars all screamed it was a ridiculous hoax.\line \line 
Ok I asked them then can I let some undergraduate students come in and touch it as part of an experiment.\line \line Preposterous the administrators in their\line \line \line You didn't mention this before t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e professor said, everyone said it had been a medical condition.\line \line 
Well yes I'm sorry for misleading you regrettable but necessary smith and really if you think about it did I mislead anyone? Should I tell the dean my condition arises from a curious box? A\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
d if you believe that i mislead you that would mean you believe this box was capable of something extraordinary, magical in fact. Do you believe that?\line \line 
Hmm yes I see your point the professor replied it is a bit far fetched. So what do you believe this box\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 is?\line \line 
Hmm well I don't like to talk about it, I am rather enjoying my tenure and wouldn't my stayin around as an emeritus but I don't think they would keep a lunatic or a scientific fraud about the place.\line \line I do believe it is otherworldly.\line \line 
I understand sai\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  the professor. How did the box come into your possession?\line \line Ah yes it was an expedition to the Artic, we were studying diatoms,\~
 of course I'm a physicist turned archaeologist so diatoms are not of particular importance to my research the expedition was m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 stly biologists and one chemist interested in the composition\~
 of ice cores.\line \line Why did you choose to go james asked?\line \line It was a manuscript that I had the fortune of analyzing I think the two are related, can we see it james cut in.\line In his excitement he alwa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s became blunt but his glowing face and eager manner made it impossible to be offended by him, he clearly meant no harm his brain just lost touch with social graces.\line \line And what do other scholars say?\line A hoax.
\line What about the effects?\line A placebo.\line \line this I've wa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hed ashore in the artic he held up a curios glass ring. It was enshrined in a small see though case the scholar who found this decided to wear it. He also kept a journal.\line \line 
He paused and stood to go stare out the window. Class had just gotten out and the s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
udents were hurrying across the windswept quad as much to get out of the blustery wind as to make it to class on time. Shreds of pale blue sky could be seen through the ragged clouds. We think There is a group trying to steal these artifacts which is not 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 urprising because they clearly possess some great powers.\line \line \line \line Elsie was not expecting such s nice house whoever they are they must be very wealthy she thought.\line \line 
I do hope there nice she whispered to Susan\line \line Yes Susan replied I'm glad Byron is here he seems \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o fit in with wealthy people.\line \line \line \line CHAPTER\line Scholars fairly skel

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ous artic expedition. Elsie pulled her hood tighter feeling pale and self conscious she hadnt had time to properly do her hair. And not getting enough sleep always made her feel pale. She looked at herself in the mirror that morning and thought I need to

Susan came in looking beautiful and wide awake like she was going to a fancy wedding, Elsie rolled her eyes and tried to think of something smart to say but couldn't she was far too tired.\line \line She quickly got over it as she wat

A young dashing looking gentleman came over he was tall and skinny but muscular and had th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 look of an English gentleman. He moved with careless ease and was smartly dressed and looked wealthy. He also looked cold and haughty as he focused intently on the loading of a large wooden case.\line \line 
Lord Byron so glad you could make it! The professor embra\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed him warmly.\line \line 
Lord Byron spoke in a thick English accent and moved with athletic and careless ease. Ladies do glad you could make it he shook there hands all warmly and beamed a wide dashing smile at them.\line \line Elsie felt a little nervous hello she said my

And I'm Susan she said pleasure to meet you.\line \line Addie sat quietly in the folds of her great cloak, t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 is is Addie Elsie said.\line \line

Titles are meaningless he joked. They all boarded the airship and were soon off soaring above the English Channel. Lord Byron came over with some scones and milk any one hun\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ry he asked cheerfully.\line \line I am Elsie said what about you she asked Addie?\line \line Oh yes please I'm very hungry now. These are delicious Susan exclaimed so fresh.\line \line 
Yes I picked them up this morning from my favorite bakery, unfortunately we won't have that conscie\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ce for long.\line \line A slim and beautiful lady waked in. She looked elegant and delicate\~
 as soon as she noticed them she quickly turned and left.\line \line I tried to talk to her earlier but she didnt seem to want to have anything to do with me.\line \line What Elsie blurted out \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ow could anyone not want to talk to you! She was really starting to like the English gentleman\line \line Well give it a few days he joked I'm sure you'll be quite sick of me.\line \line 
I do have quite a bit of energy, I was quite the terror as a youngster My parents didn't\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 know what to do with me.\line \line 
Where are the professor joked. When did this change. I heard about the recent prank you pulled. You really Are quite the ringleader when it comes to making trouble.\line \~That is true he laughed, my father was glad ill be up in the ar
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ic, Byron stood up doing his best to look stuffy and dignified.\line \line The artic. What the dither are you doing in the artic.\line 
He stood with his arms folded behind his back as he paced regally Doing his best imitation of his father (which if you know his father \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ou'll realize is quite good)\line \line 
Well he went on imitating his father At least you'll find it difficult to cause trouble up there nothing but snow and blasted ice. I don't know why you won't be reasonable and settle into banking like your older brothers.\line \line Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  professor laughed that is a good impression of your father.\line \line The girls all laughed too though they didnt know his father they could imagine a dignified English\~ banker.\line \line 
The funny thing is, he went on in his normal voice.\line \line My grandfather was quite the ro\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ge and adventurer. He made out fortune but in his youth he was in and out of prison, lost his temper at a commanding officer and, plunk picked him up and tossed him into the sea.\line He was dishonorably discharged and ended up in a military prison.\line 
\line I love hi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  though he wasn't a bad sort or a criminal just fiery and full of pasison. My mother says I take after him, but I have yet to end up in prison and I hope to keep it that way.
\line \line It was a nice night for sailing, the dead were calm and it was a surprisingly w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rm night, they sat on the deck bundled in blankets and sweaters Talking and drinking warm cocoa and tea. The professor came out with a plate of warm cookies and freshly cut apples.\line \line Anna backed these he said for us he said.\line \line 
Is she coming out? Lord Byron \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 sked perhaps a little too quickly no one caught it but susan who cast a knowing glance at Elsie who was too busy with her own love interest, the\line 
Plate of cookies.\line \line Oh my those do look delicious she said.\line \line No james said she said she had some reading to do \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nd was going back to her bunk.\line \line 
Ah righto Byron said trying to hide his discouragement those do smell delicious your quite right.\line \line Well if you all going to be polite I'm gonna help mylsekf Elsie said grabbing one with a smile.\line \line Everyone else took one too.
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Oh my these are delicious Elsie said.\line \line I quite agree Susan said. What do you think Addie Susan said.\line \line 
Good Addie said with a smile. Elsie knew she would say more if there were less people around.\line \line I could see why being a professor would be nice Susan said.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  Going on cruises summers off not worries.\line \line 
Oh hold up a minute james laughed. You might not be paid for the summer but that doesn't mean you won't be working a lot or faculty want a 11 month appointment.\line \line \line Yes and don't forget those frayed students sleep
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ng in your class and forgetting thier homework Benjamin said with a sigh.\line \line \line And piles of data\line \line Mountains of data\line \line 
And trying to get tenure said Jonas the youngest member who was still only a year into his post doc.\line \line I wouldn't change it for the world thou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h James said.\line \line 
Me neither they all quickly agreed.\line \line What's that Addie said she pointed to the night sky where a strange blue light was glowing in the distance.\line \line \line \line \line \line They think there doing good to save the world from expiation.
\line \line She felt they were sailing \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hrough space and time the air felt strangely charged. Everyone was quiet lost in there own thoughts\line \line 
The girls snuggled into their bunks. The seas were relatively calm and peaceful. As Elsie came in from brushing her teeth Addie was already curled up cove\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed in blankets.\line \line 
Oh you look cozy Elsie said Addie smiled at her I am and the blankets are perfect it does get cold up in the artic.\line \line Well I don't think we're to the artic yet I imagine its going to get much colder.\line \line 
Susan walked in hi su Elsie said. Hell\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  Susan said as she flopped down on Addie's bed. You sure look comfortable Susan smiled.\line \line 
We were just talking about that Elsie said when we are camping out on the ice it's going to get very cold.\line \line I know I'm a little worrie Susan said but I am glad we wi \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e with such seasoned explorers.\line \line Oh guess what Addie said poking her face out from under her covers. Her blond hair was wild and beautiful.\line \line I talked to Anna I helped her back the cookies.\line \line 
What! Susan and Elsie both exclaimed.\line \line What's she like\line \line Is she ni\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\line \line She hasn't said one word the whole trip.\line \line 
Ya I thought she was a snob who thinks shes to smart for everyone else.\line \line I went to Harvard Elsie said drawing out her words and trying to look conceited.\line \line Yes Susan said she thinks she is too good for lord Byro
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 And I don't think you can find anyone more handsome them him.\line \line Except for father Elsie put in.\line \line Yes that's true Susan chimed in.\line \line 
No she is really nice Addie said I think she is shy.\line \line How did you meet her Elsie asked. Ell I went I to the Kitchen to get\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a snack and she was starting I back them.\line \line 
We didnt say anything at first then she said that she thought I was lucky to have two older sisters. She said she was an only child and her parents were both old when she was born and she was raised by her grandm\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a.\line 
\line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Now I want to talk I get Elsie said I wonder if she is still awake.\line \line When I walked by her room it looked like her light was still in susan said.\line \line Well that settled it elsie said jumping out of bed.
\line \line Come on Addie she said as she went over to her little\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 sister.\line \line 
Ok let me out on a sweater I'm cold. Addie grabbed a sweater and Elsie and Susan did too. As the ship sailed further towards the artic the nights were becoming increasingly chillier.\line \line Ok everyone ready susan said.\line \line 
Well maybe we shouldn't Elsie r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 plied suddenly feeling shy.\line \line Will be fine Susan said.\line \line 
Maybe we could bring her something Elsie mused that way it's no like we're just barging in.\line \line Something like what, a pony Susan said with a faint smile she tried to hide.\line \line Elsie rolled her eyes yes let\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  being her a pony I'm sure there all out grazing on the upper deck probably cold to I'm sure they would love to share your bed with you tonight.\line \line They probably wouldn't kick worse then you do Susan quipped back.
\line \line Whatever you say miss blanket Steeler.\line \line We\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l at least for now we all\line Have out own beds. They all giggled.\line \line 
I was thinking more along the lines of a nice snack.\line \line I would love some warm cocoa with whip cream Addie said.\line \line They patterned out into the ships narrow halls as they made their way Aup to th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  galley.\line \line It sure is quiet in here tonight elsie said everybody must be upstairs riding the ponies.\line \line It's not called the upstairs on a ship susan said.\line \line 
Elsie rolled her eyes again then went on mischievously all I know is were in the basement and we need \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o go upstairs to the kitchen.\line \line Susan ignore her come on let's go.!\line \line 
Elsie knocked timidly on the door she wasn't feeling so bold anymore.\line \line Come in a pretty voice said from the other side of the door.\line \line Elsie timidly opened the door I hope we didnt wake you\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ?\line \line 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Oh know she laughed im a night owl.\line \line Then she added quickly who is we?\line \line Oh Elsie said just me and my two sisters.\line \line Oh come in come in anna stood up and opene the door. Hi Addie she said warmly.
\line \line We brought you some coca Addie said.\line \line Oh you girls are too\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 sweet she said.\line \line 
Elsie and everyone sat at the ships rails staring out at the frozen artic town. People live here she asked incedullouslly?\line \line Yes professor james replied. They get around with sleds but it is a very remote village the island can only be rea
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hed by ships. But even though it's remote it's a fairly large little city and there are some fun shops we can visit.\line \line 
As you can see its a fairly busy port for gold miners adventures and cargo ships.\line \line Elsie felt a little nervous about getting off with all\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
those rough people who might be living there. She realized the ship was starting to feel a little like home with their cost little bedroom.\line \line 
At that moment Addie came up on deck looking like a little blond Eskimo with her thick fur coat surrounding her fa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e like a mane.\line \line 
Hi Addie Elsie said. Addie smiled Back what a strange city that is. Where are we?\line \line Susan said I'm not sure but somewhere getting closer to the artic.\line \line \line 
Ya and I think we are going to go ashore soon Elsie said. Some of the crew were working\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 to ready the bit as it approached the rustic looking harbor.\line \line 
Lord Byron came over looking dashing and adventurous. Wanna go ashore and look around be asked?\line \line Yes the girls all exclaimed.\line \line It is safe right Susan asked a little timidly.\line \line Oh of course he la\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ghed. Well I suppose it can get a little rough but wi be fine he smiled. They climbed aboard the smaller boat and two of the crew rowed them to to dock. They then climbed up the ladder to the large and aged wooden peor. The city spread out before them woo
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
en bushes and shops that sheltered in the small valley. Steep mountains covered in pine and fir forest towered around the little port town. Higher up the trees were wreathed in clouds and mist that rose to the gray skyline. Quite a site Elsie said taking 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t all in as they stood atop the pier they turned and looked ou\~ at the sheltered bay full of ships and boats.\line \line 
I can't believe anyone lives here Susan responded it seems so remote but is awfully pretty.\line \line Yes I think there is some charm for some people in \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
eing Away from things, the pioneer spirit as the Yankees would say. I find it a bit appealing but i think ok more of an expeditionary person, it's nice to get out in the solitude but it also feels good to get back.\line \line 
So and you should see it in the winter \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ord Byron said. They get a lot of snow here.\~ And it's very isolated also for a couple months it's dark all year round.\line \line 
Oh I don't know if I'd like that much dark Elsie said.\line \line Yes but they also get about a month of sun.\line \line Well at the sake of sounding diff\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
cult I'm not sure id like that either Elsie laughed.\line \line 
I agree Byron said its fun to experience though. We're going have some long dark nights before were safely on the other side of our adventure. And even if you prepare dr it it's still a bit rough. Good\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 companions are critical to keeping your spirits up.\line \line They headed off the dock and into the interesting town. It reminded Elsie of a fort somewhat with it's remote location.\line \line 
It was fun looking at all the strange buildings and shops and adventurous looking\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 people.\line \line There is actually\~ a really delicious restaurant here that we can go to when we get hungry.
\line \line I hope that's soon laughed Elsie I should have eaten more breakfast Byron pulled out his watch well it is 1 already definitely lunch time. Who else is hu\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 gry?\line \line 
I am both Susan and Addie jumped in. Well that makes four of ya said Byron it's off to lunch!\line \line They made there way up a street that wound up the hill. They shops were surprisingly well kept up be brightly panted\line \line 
It's pretty nice here susan said.\line \line Y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  I'm. Little less worried about food poisoning now Elsie laughed.\line \line You'll love this place Byron said trust me he smiled.\line \line 
Then he tried to nonchablty say so when you asked anna to come what did she say.\line \line Susan gave Elsie a quick sly smile.\line \line Then said she \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ad some reading to finish to finish and said she would come later.\line \line Quite right.\line \line Ah did she say would want to meet us , I oh don't want her to feel left out.\line \line She didnt say Elsie said feeling a bit bad.\line \line 
Well no matter Byron said Elsie thought it seemed \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ike he was trying to seem cheerful but she couldn't tell.\line \line 
The best minute he was back to his normal self as he began to describe the food choices they had. There stew is amazing especially on a cold artic day like today.\line \line Oh that sounds delicious Susan s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 id so they have good bread?\line \line Oh yes Byron said enthusiastically the best all made fresh. They reached the place it was warm and inciting. They sat at a nice booth in the back.\line \line 
They ordered the stew and fresh warmed bread for everyone.\line \~After the meal the\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  went looking at some of the other shops on the street, they were full of all kinda of interesting things.
\line \line Addie found a small beautiful telescope that she couldn't put down, look at this Elsie she said.\line \line Susan and Elsie crowded around oh that is wonderf\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
l. It's a shame it's so expensive.\line \line Yes Addie sighed I think I'm gonna save up and get one.\line \line You'll have to save you allowance for Elsie scrunched her face trying to concentrate two and a half years.\line 
I think it would be worth it Addie said.\line We could look \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t the stars. There so lovely and far away.\line \line I know Elsie said I've always loved the idea of them.\line 
I think I'm gonna try to save up and get one Addie said thoughtfully.\line \line Talking about there allowance made them all realize they missed there father. I hope w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 find father soon. Me too Susan said.\line \line Think of how much fun it would be he gather were with us.\line \line Elsie sighed. Will find him again I'm sure of it.\line \line 
Addie carefully set the telescope back and they walked over to where Byron was browsing the apparel.\line \line I th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nk I'm gonna buy this he said, holding up an enormously\~
 ugly flannel shirt.\line \line Eww Elsie said without thinking.\line \line Elsie! Susan jumped in, mind your manners\line \line You don't like it Byron laughed here's the thing, he lowered his voice in a conspiratorial manner. W
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ere were going there's not a lot of people or ladies but there is a lot of cold and this is just the type of thing I would want for that.\line \line He smiled broadly holding it up.\line 
\line What do you think he said holding it up to Susan. Well she said, it is rather, er \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ovel well it does look like it would keep you warm.\line \line Warm and single Elsie laughed.\line 
\line Even Susan tried to hold back a laugh.\line \line What about anna Elsie burst out with out thinking then clapped her hands over her mouth.\line \line Susan grabbed her Elsie you brat!\line \line Addie\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 tried to hide a giggle.\line \line That settled it Byron said I'm buying it for sure. Like I said no one I need to impress.\line \line They went up to the shopkeeper a rather burly women, oh my that is lovely she said.\line 
\line Thank you Byron said.\line \line They went out side and Byron sai\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  oh wait one second. He went back in the shop. And came out with a package. He handed it to Addie.\line \line 
What's this Addie asked her heart rising at the shape of the long circular package. P\line \line Open it Byron beamed with joy.\line \line Oh no you don't have to buy us anyth\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ng both Elsie and Susan exclaimed.\line \line We can share it! Addie said\line \line No no he laughed I got this lovely coat and Addie got something we all need a surprise besides I won't be able to buy anything for mounts I gotta get it out if my system.
\line \line Well that is very \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ind of you Elsie said.\line \line 
Great it's settled he said as he put on his new flannel coat. How's it look. He was so handsome and dashing he looked good in anything. Well Elsie said its a little better then I expected.\line \line As Susan and Elsie went about the store e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 x\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 claiming in joy he leaned over to Addie and whispered can you keep a secret\line \line Yes she said.\line \line 
Well I know it's really quite hideous, a monstrosity of fashion. Which is why I plan to wear it around my father at all times especially at fancy events.\line \line Addie gi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
gled I think I'm starting to like it.\line \line They might the girls talked\line \line 
Oh look at this Susan Elsie called from across the store holding up a beautiful globe of the earth. With this will never be lost again. Susan laughed yes and you could for it nicely in yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
r back pocket.\line \line Hmm yes that's true it would be a little large for my back pocket Elsie said maybe I should look for something practical for the trip.\line \line 
Oh I know what I am going to get Susan said holding up a beautiful coat that looked both stylish and wa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m.\line \line 
I like that Elsie said. I think I wanna get the same thing but in this color she said holding up anothe style of one.\line \line Lord Byron Susan called I think we found what we want.\line \line Are you sure it's ok?\line \line 
Oh yes he said in fact I insist.\line \line And now I say we sh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 uld head to the markets\~ and load up on some fresh provisions and snacks.\line \line 
They all piled into their bunks for the evening,\~ well that was a fun day\~ Susan said. They were all sitting on Addie's bed curled up in their warm blankets and snacking on the can\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
y they had purchased in the market.\line \line This chocolate is really good I think it has orange in it, hey we should see if anna would like some.\line \line That's a good idea Addie replied enthusiastically.\line \line 
Ill get her Elsie said my jumping up by with her blanket still \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 arlier tightly around her.\line \line 
She hurried lightly out the door and down the hall padding with her bare feet on the cold ships floor. I should have grabbed my slippers she thought to herself. She was quickly at Anna's door and the might was on. She knocked q
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ietly.\line \line Come in her soft and beautiful voice rang out.\line \line 
Hello Elsie said shyly she still wasn't totally comfortable around anna, she seemed so stylish and quiet and intelligent. But she felt of she got to know her, maybe she had misjudged her. She seemed \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o kind the last time they had spoken.\line \line Elsie gathered her courage,\~ do you like candy? We got some in the town and wanted to share it with you do you wanna come down to our cabin?\line 
Addie and is cabin Susan had her own side rolls but she is with us she blur\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed out all at once.\line \line 
Anna smiled oh thank you I'dive to. They both quickly padded back down the cold hall into their room.\line \line Hi girls anna said cheerfully.\line We missed you today Susan said you should have joined us!\line \line

The first thing she noticed about him was how sad his eyes looked, not hollow or empty they had a fire and a spark of life hidden deep down but sadness seemed caused them to be buried deep down. He was tall and looked to be powerfully b

 He looked handsome but it was also hard to tell with his long hair and beard. He also looked ageless his long beats made him look older but he looked like younger features could be hidden beneath.\line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 L

\line \line \line \line \line Chapter 6\line Elsie woke up she was cold and felt stiff and sore. Something that felt like ice was\line pressed against her face making her uncomfortable and at the same time almost\~ numb. She pressed her hands\line 
down to push her self up and somethi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g painful burned into her palms. She opened her eyes\line and realized she was lying in snow and ice. It took her a few minutes to gather her wits and\line 
remember where she was, though she realized she had no idea where she was.\line \line As she stood up shackily she look\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d around at the vast expanse of giant mountains surrounding her. They
\line looked rugged and forbiding. She realized she was in a mountain valley surrounded by snow and ice clad mountains and jagged precipices, some appeared to have rugged trees, mostly bare b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t with a few evergreens buried under the white of snow. From where she stood the\line 
valley was fairly level but sloped up towards the mountain ranges encircling it. She guessed that in the summer the valley was probably briefly covered in grass and she saw a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
pine forest in the direction of what she believe was the setting sun. Thought it may have been rising she was not sure at all what time it was. Now in the winter the whole place was just ice rock and snow and barren trees and evergreens.\line \line 
Suddenly she rea\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ized neither of her sisters were any where nearby, they had been what felt like minutes earlier.\line 
"Addie! Susan!" she called out. "Where are you?" She felt a rising panic as she looked around hoping for a site of color or movement.\line She had forgotten how co\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

She stood motionless for a few minutes listening to the sound of sil\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nce, a whole world\~ muffled by snow. She decided to head towards\line 
what looked like small forest rising far off on the slopes of the mountains to the west. She guessed it couldn't be more then\line 4 or 5 miles and hoped that she would be able to find her sister\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 . She also hoped that on higher ground she\line could perhaps see movement or spot something to help her find them.\line \line 
She started moving through the snow drifts and had made some progress, occasionaly yelling out for her sisters. She had not gotten very far whe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 she saw with a rise of joy what appeared to be some blue up ahead. She broke into a run hoping it was Addie's dress.\line \line \~
As she got closer she saw with both dread and hope a small body huddled on the snow. "Addie, Addie" she screamed as she ran up. She\line stu\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
bled through the snow and reached her sisters body, She picked her up and clutched her to her chest, she was still breathing but her tiny frail body was limp and motionless. "Oh Addie, please wake up, please wake up" she said as tears began to form and fr
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 eze on her face. She clung to her in a hug feeling totally lost and afraid.\line \line 
She knew that they were someplace remote and that she would have to figure out something to keep them both warm. The only thing around\line them was snow. She sat there and it felt li\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e time had stood still as she clung to Addie hoping to warm her little sister with her body heat.\line \line It was when hope seemed to be fading out that she felt or sensed she was being watched. She turned slowly and against the rising ground\line 
behind her she saw a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 figure, she instanly knew was a dwarf. His face and eyes were far to wild to be human. He was clad in rugged\line 
furs, fur boots and a blue cloak. He held a enourmous double bladed battle axe and sat staring at the sisters, his large beard jutting out ferousc\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
osly. He was a forbidding presence, it seemed a great viking warrior had suddenly walked out\line from the pages of history.\line \line He said something unitelligble and Elsie responded somewhat shackily from a combination of cold and fear,\line 
"Please, can you help us my \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ister is freezing to death." At the moment she suddenly felt like they were not going to freeze to death and it might be more likely they would meet a much quicker and more violent end.\line \line 
The dwarf responded in a rough voice slowly, "Are you a spirit?"\line \line "A\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 spirit" Elsie replied?\line Elsie woke up she was cold and felt stiff and sore. Something that felt like ice was

\line in the current circumstances it felt appropriate to her) "M\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  sister needs help, can you help us?"\line \line 
The dwarf didn't seem to pay any attention to her response. "Are you a ghost then" he said?\line \line "No" Elsie said, I am a girl and this is my sister we are lost and cold"\line \line The dwarf continued to stare at them both. Elsie 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 oticed he also had swung his shield around as if getting ready for a fight and he had raised his battle axe his whole body seemed tensed for sudden movement.\line \line 
"Sounds like something a spirit would say" the dwarf muttered.\line \line he shook his head a number of ti\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 es then began to trudge noisly towards them. He approached loudly but also\line 
warily, as if the two sisters were a pair of wild dragons waiting to devour him.\line \line He came close puffing and blowing and stomping through the snow like a great noisy freight engine.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Elsie felt a little hope but also worry as she stared at his bright battle axe.\line \line As the dwarf approached his manner changed a little, Elsie realized he was scared if that was possible for so fierce a figure.\line \line 
She decided to try to put him at ease.\line \line "Than\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  you" she said, my sister and I are lost and our other sister Susan is lost somewhere too.\line \line 
The dwarf didn't respond as he moved closer.\line \line When he got close enough for his axe to make short work of both of them he stood irresolute.\line \line "well he said, "If you \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
re going to do something you better now, other wise I am going to try to help your sister"\line \line "Ok, thank you!" Said Elsie.\line \line His mannerism changed as he dropped the axe and quickly went to work he pulled off his large fur\~
 garment and tenderly wrapped Addie \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n it.\line \line It reminded Elsie of a father and a small child.\line \line She also saw a flash of concern cross his small face.\line \line 
"here he said" Handing his other coat to Addie "no sense two of you freezing to death."\line \line "Thank you Elsie said.\line \line He muttered, "how did two of y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
u get so far up in the mountains with no packs or warm clothes"\line \line He looked quickly at her out of the corner of his eye with a dark work as if his old suspicions were coming back that they were some\line 
kind of fey or spirit children or something worse trying \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o lure his guard down him in.\line \line 
"Your sister is in bad shape" he said I am gonna give her some YYY. We dwarfs like it for when we want to get a little rowdy, it also does a good\line job of warming you. Normally I wouldn't give it to a child but you sister look
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  like she could use a little warmth and a little rowdy spirit.\line \line 
He pulled out a thick and strangely shaped bottle and poured some into Addies mouth. Though his words were gruffly spoken his movements were full of concern.\line \line Addie sputtered a little and wea\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ly opened her eyes. Elsie screamed out in joy, "Addie, Addie!" She grabbed her sister and pulled her close into a tight embrace. "Don't squeeze her to death the drwarf said not unkindly as he suddenly began cleaning something from his eye and muttering to
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 him self in some strange and harsh language.\line \line \line 
As she laid her back down across her legs Addie smiled weakly at her. Elsie suddenly felt she could understand how the dwarf could mistake them for ghosts\line Addie looked pale and beautiful like a spirit frail a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d fragile, delicate and pale yet beautiful.\line \line 
Elsie looked over as the dwarf brushed something from his eye, was it a tear? She couldn't be sure but she managed to stop the flood of her own tears unleashed by all the emotions running through here.\line \line Her joy\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 was short lived though as she remembered Susan was still out someplace in this vast mountain range.\line \line We have to find my other sister she said.\line \line 
We're gonna need someone to find us soon if we don't get to warmth and shelter He replied\line \line We can't leave Susan\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 out here Elsie responded with panic in her voice.\line \line 
No we can't the dwarf said but we need to get you to warm then ill go back out and look for her.\line \line Oh thank you! Elsie said is there a city nearby?\line \line The drwarf laughed a short barking laugh. Yes if your up\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 for a good 20\line days march and that's assuming it doesn't snow, if the snow comes you could be lost forever, but you'd freeze long before forever ever got here.\line \line oh no what will we do Elsie said.\line \line 
Her questions and mannerisms showing she had already lost mo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t of her fear of the drawf and had come to rely on him to get them out of their situation.\line \line 
Well he said I'm traveling to a ziggurat it's a secret of my people so ill have to blindfold you as we get close but we will be safe and warm there, then ill load \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
p on supplies and go back out to look for your sister.\line \line Oh I hope we can find her do you think we can Elsie said. Her words slurred together she had a tendency of speaking fast when she was excited or nervous.\line \line 
Well he said ill do my best and this snows a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 dratted bother but it will make picking up her trail up that much easier.\line \line 
Good it's settled then Elsie said we can both go and head out in different directions.\~ the dwarf was about to contradict her and say it was far too dangerous\~ but he could sense h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
r steely resolve. She might not be a ghost but there was something far deeper then the small blond girl sitting in front of him showed.\line \line 
He decided to take a different tactic because he knew she was far too exhausted and he knew someone not used to these \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ountains could get lost easy and there were dangerous and dark things that haunted the night.\line \line So instead he said I think you would be better off tending your sister Susan and I would much prefer to come back to both of you warm and safe.\line 
\line Well I guess yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r right Elsie said how far is this place?\line \line 
It's a couple hours march from here he responded as long as it doesn't start to snow but it seems like a clear night so far but the weather can be dangerous and unpredictable in the mountains and these mountains \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n particular are particularly inhospitable. Even if we hurry it will be dark by then so we best get moving and make the most of the remaining daylight.\line \line 
He stood up abruptly picked up Addie and said well you ready for a night march? If you get tired you c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n ride on my back.\line \line 
I don't want you to carry both of us Elsie said, I'm not a little girl I can walk through the snow just fine.\line \line Oh ho ho so now your not a little girl not too long ago I seem to recall differently the drawf teased at her.\line \line Well that is 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rue Elsie laughed. And if you didn't have to carry Addie I would\line 
take you up on your offer because I feel exhausted but I don't want to slow us down and I fear for Susan and the sooner we get back the sooner you can look for her.\line \line Righto said the drwaf le\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s move were making for the dark line of trees ahead. They set off trudging through the snow and speaking little they were both exhausted and the drwarf had his weapons fear and Addie he was carrying. He also had been setting a hectic pace (even for drwave
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ) and hadnt had much rest or sleep in a week, he had been relying on reaching the ziggurat for safety and rest and had been concerned of being caught in a blizzard.\line \line 
They hadnt been walking more then a half hour when, well maybe we should check in on Susa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Susan woke up she was cold and disoriented. She way laying on her back stating up at a beautiful pale blue winter sky. She felt to shacky to move but the cold was eating through her clothes so she pushed her self up and gazed at the massive and forbidd
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ng mountains all around her.\line \line She was in the same mountain valley that both Addie and Elsie were in but she didnt know it at the moment she felt terribly small and alone.\line \line 
I wish father were here she thought he would know what to do, but the thought didnt\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 help her it just made her feel more alone and confused.\line \line 
She decided to look for Addie and Elsie and called out to both of them when she had a curious feeling she wasn't alone. She turned slowly to her right and didnt see anything and spin all the way bac\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  to her starting place only seeing a range of far off mountains cloaked in snow in every direction.\line \line 
She felt the panic leaving and though to her self, I'm just being silly and I need to stay calm. She had the thought a moment to soon because she realized\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
with dread that on the far ridge their was a bear staring right at her.\line \line 
For a minute she felt her knees go weak and she felt too paralyzed to move. She snapped out of it and begin to run and stumble through the snowdrifts. It was painful and hard the sno\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 was deep and it was exhausting work. She didnt dare to turn and see if the bear was after her she just plunged onward tell he kinda began to burn. She ran about 20 minutes when she stumbled and plunged to her knees in a snow drift. She caught herself wit
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 her hands and the cold snow shocked her hands. She sat gasping for air as she turned. She didnt see the bear anywhere and for a moment she felt her heart lift in hope but it didnt last Long the bear was definitely stalking her. It was close but not too c
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ose and had come up in front of her blocking her way.\line \line She wanted to cry and lay down in the snow but the thought of Addie and Elsie out ther somewhere alone made her feel fierce.
\line \line She started running and the bear would trail her sometimes cutting her off\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
sometimes letting her run. She realized with fright the bear was toying with her she knew it could catch her whenever it wanted but she refused to give up, luckily it was forcing her toward a forest of dark trees and she though if she climbed a small one 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 aybe it would leave her alone.\line \line 
She had been running (and walking when she couldn't run anymore) for what seemed like hours, in reality it had been closer to about 45 minutes and she had covered a lot of ground in spite of the snow and icy covered valley.\line \line 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 She had covered another mile and thought maybe the bear had given up but when she turned to look she saw it still behind her. But something ahead caught her eye thee figures walking ahead in the snow.\line \line 
She begin to call out as they got closer bear! bear!\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
She relied that it was Addie and Elsie and She felt relief her sisters were ok, but then she realized she was leading a bear right towards them.\line \line 
They had seen her and were racing towards her a stranger was carrying Addie and she felt worry rush over her,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 was she ok?\line \line Susan Susan! Elsie screamed your ok!\line \line 
A bear! A bear is chasing me Susan screamed. The next few moments were all confusion Susan and Elsie embracing In a quick hug. And then Susan pointing at the large bear coming over the snow drifts towards\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 them.\line \line 
At this moment the Drawf showed that he was both capable and brave he said hello you just be Susan in a calm voice handed Addie to Elsie and like lightning had Drawn his battle axe and shield and was striding towards the bear. He had out his shield
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 up and was crouched\~ down low.\line \line Addie said oh please don't hurt the bear\line \line 
He yelled at the bear and crashed his axe on his shield. The bear seemed to lose interest it had risen up briefly then dropped down and ambled off most likely looking for easier pre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y.\line \line 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 "Oh Susan I can't believe you were Chased by a bear, how brave of you and you too mr drwaf!"\line \line The girls hugged again while Elsie explained how they had met the drwarf and that they were hurrying to get Addie warm.
\line \line After the chaos and fear everyone fel\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 even more exhausted but they kept on. The drwaf encouraged them all and stayed behind with his axe out keeping a protective eye over the group. The dark was coming fast and by the time they reached the trees the evening had arrived. Luckily there was a f
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ll moon but still the forest seemed errie and quiet with just the sound of their breathing and the crunch of snow under their feet.\line \line 
If you were a bird on a branch in the forest (you probably would be wishing you had flown south for the winter) but if you\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hadn't\~
 you would have seen four figures marching through the moonlight night not clad at all for a snowy night. In fact a bird was watching, silly humans, they won't last long, but a dwarf, a dwarf should know better he thought as he fluttered off.\line \line 
And \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he bird was right they were all getting cold and the heat from their running and marching had left them damp and now it was beginning to freeze on them.\line 
They took turns carrying Addie and were all soon feeling almost catatonic.\line A wind also picked up and c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 illed them to the bone.\line \line 
They marched on through the still forest as the bright moon reflected upon the snow covering the dark and silent forest floor.if they had been staying at a mountain cabin they would have enjoyed the walk and the dark blue of the e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ening sky and the strange light reflecting from the moon that made the dark pine and for trees quite visible.\line \line 
They began heading steadily upward as they approached the foothills of the mountain range. The mountains rose abruptly from the valley and the\line d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
arf said encouragingly, "were almost there then we can get warm and a warm meal going.\line \line Oh I'm so hungry said Susan\line \line 
Me too replied Elsie "and cold" and right as she said that a wintery blast of wind blew through the trees and cut through their clothes ch\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 lling them to the vibe.\line \line 
After that they fell silent with their own thoughts,\~ all their energy spent. Clouds had begun to roll in and the moonlight was fading out. It was becoming harder to see and Now it was just one painful step after another. They had
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
reached a rocky place and began winding their way up a slim path that was steep and covered in snow. Sometimes Elsie would stumble and have to catch her self with her hands in the cold snow. The last time she had stumbled she couldn't get up but lay panti
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g too cold and exhausted to move.\line \line 
The drwaf gently helped her up "were almost there he said, your doing great I would say lets take a break but we really need to get to shelter.he looked up at the sky worriedly, the first small drops of snow were beginni\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g to fall from the ominous clouds gathering across the western peaks far far above them.\line \~
from inside a warm cabin it would have been a beautiful night as the snow gently began to fall but out alone in the wild it was perilous.\line \line ok Elsie said as they cont\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
nued their march. Out of the corner or her eye Elsie thought she movement in the trees to the right and it got her thinking about what other creatures may be up here besides bears. She decided to ask the drwaf at Least it would help pass the time.\line 
\line "You m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ntioned things worse then bears up here. What types of things she got out between tired pauses."\line \line 
Oh ho ho be replied so being tired cold and hungry isn't enough you want to be scared too?\line \line Well Elsie said letting out a small laugh maybe it will take my m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nd off of it.\line \line 
That's true the drwarf said well actually this valley and the mountains around here are fairly safe in fact that's the first bear I have ever seen in these mountains, im sure there are lots but they usually keep their distance from us.\line \line \~Ev
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
l things generally don't come to this particular range but they do roam these mountains. In the lower foothills far from here their are goblins that hunt and prey on unsuspecting travelers. Before the fair folk died out these mountains were mostly safe bu
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  the goblins will pass over them from time to time and deeper creatures and spirits have been haunting them.\line \line 
There are far more evil and dark places the black mountains are so dark and dangerous no one will go near them. About 100 years ago a large and w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rlike group of drwaves set out to establish a mine in their lower hills. The expedition went badly they were haunted by nightmares from the very start. A small group of drwaves went Mad attacking and killing many of the other drwaves before they were subd
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ed. That was a strange occurrence the aggressive drwaves had no recollection all had the same story that they were attacked by dark spirits and were fighting them off. A few days later they woke up and over half the party was dead, and not just dead it wa
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a rather gruesome seen not fit for the ears of young children on dark nights.\line \line How far away are these mountains Susan asked.\line \line 
Oh quite far from here no need to worry but their evil influence has been spreading across the land.\line \line I should have kept my mont\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  shut said Elsie only half joking.\line \line 
I'm sorry the drwaf said, I should have saved those wild tales my father was one of the drwaves that survived. They ended up setting up another expedition to the north on an entire continent of nothing but snow and rock\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 and ice. The place is still almost totally empty. The shifting ice can trap and crush even great ships. And the temperatures and Blizzards are life threatening.\line \line quiet beneath the moon\line \line 
but a group of dwarves set out to mine the southern mountains. Some e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rly explorers had found evidence of precious stones and also good sting metals for smithing and building. It awoke a fire in their dwarvish hearts far hotter then the Ice and snow that covers the lands.\line \line 
they built great ships and filled them with good an\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  supplies and set out. I've heard it was a wonderous site. Not the least of which you don't see lots of dwarves on ships.\line \line \~
It was a rugged life for them but they all got fabulously rich. The great trader ships manned by humans and dwarves would come for \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he precious metals and stones every summer. With them they would bring food and tales of the outside world. My father said after the first year it was quite enjoyable they lived far underground and it was warmer down there my father was an adventurous sou
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  and him and some of the more hardy dwarves would venture out and explore the continent.\line \line 
One night a group of about 15 of them were surrounded by strange glowing lights in the distance. They were all scared witless and lit a large fire everyone stayed aw\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ke watching the lights circle around them.\line \line Some of them swore they heard laughter, my father says he heard something but he thinks it was the wind.\line \line what do you think it was said Susan.\line \line 
Well I'm not rightly sure maybe something natural maybe creatures f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 om the stars maybe some ice beings that live\~ down there.\line \line 
My father and some of the arcane researchers think there maybe a warm spot somewhere on the continent where trees and grass and forests are but no one has ever found it. It was mostly handed down \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rom old legends legends older then the drwaves.\line \line Oh another thing said the dwarf, there the night will last for months in the winter and the sun won't set for most of the summer, it's very strange and fascinating.
\line \line I wish there wasn't so much trouble id l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ve to go exploring up there.\line \line 
I have some stories I can tell when we are safe and warm but we are in a very remote corner of the mountains long ago the drwaves mined these mountains my ancestors built were we are going to. We are in the blue mountains and
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 right now the biggest threats are snow and cold and freezing or starving to death. That's part of why wee are safe most people even goblins won't come this far up here.\line \line 
that's very interesting Elsie said. I'd love to see that place.\line \line Addie had regained c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
nscious a little and am said weakly I wouldn't mind either, if you would remind carrying me mr drwaf.\line \line 
They all laughed and both Elsie and Susan felt a pulse of joy and warmth as their hopes rose that Addie would be ok. The drwaf was glad too but he was a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
so concerned the snow was now falling heavily and be knew they were on the verge of all freezing to death. As hardy as he was he knew he was at the end of his strength. His muscles burned and he felt shivers overtaking his body from the cold. He had had a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 much longer journey up into the mountains and hadnt eaten in 3 days.\line \line \line 
Addie said I feel warmer and better now I can walk. Her voice sounded weak and faint and the dwarf looked at Susan and Elsie questioningly.\line \line Are you sure Addie? Susan said.\line \line She didnt \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
espond and hung there like a little rag doll. Both Susan and Elsie felt concerned for her again as they continued to trudge up the steep mountain path as the snow blew around them. It was coming down thickly now, blowing and swirling and making it difficu
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t and treacherous to hike up the steep path.\line \line 
It would have been the type of storm that would be lovely to watch from inside a warm house with a fire burning bright and mugs of warm cocoa. But it was a terrible night to be out in. The wind picked up and t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e icy chill it drive felt almost angry as it pounded against them.\line \line 
Elsie felt totally numb, like she would fall over at any second and never rise again. She was about to fall over when Susan beat her to it, she just went to take a step and fell face firs\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 into a snow drift. The drwaf and Susan couldn't rouse her and the dwarf had a very concerned look on his face that was almost hidden behind the snow clinging to his beard.\line \line Finally they got Susan to her feet and staggered on.\line \line 
It began to feel like that'\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 the only world Elsie had ever known just picking up one foot and setting it down further up the path. That and overwhelming exhaustion and cold. He clothes were soaked through and the wind ate away at her skin.\line \line 
She felt like she was about to give up whe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  the dwarf gave a shout muffled by the snow but quite clear.\line \line 
We're close! That large stone on the left marks the entrance. They turned off on a side path sheltered by cliffs, the snow and wind were less here and the snow wasn't as deep. They walked betwe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n the Rock walls and soon came to a dead end. Elsie felt her spirits fall and Susan said quietly, were lost. Her voice was full of exhaustion and despair.\line \line \line 
No no the dwarf said excitedly as he fumbled for a key in his pack he had handed Addie to Elsie an\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 pulled out a key. He fumbled as he tried to put it into a small hole and Elsie noticed his hands were almost blue he had given his gloves to Elsie and Susan and his hands had been exposed as he carried Addie.\line \line 
She realized how selfless and kind the dwarf\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 was caring so deeply for strangers. He managed to get the key in and he shoved hard as the Rock wall\~
 moved inwards. It wasn't the whole wall but simply a small part that was a door that perfectly matched the Rock face.\line \line Then the next thing Elsie knew she\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
was inside a small dark narrow cave. She had to duck to avoid the low roof and she felt a pang of disappointment it was out of the cold but still freezing and dark. Then she thought what a brat I'm being at least will not die in here.\line \line 
Susan said oh it's \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ovely.\line \line 
Elsie knew she wasn't being honest and thought she would make a good diplomat or politician she was about to say so when she realized again she was just tired and irritable and she also realized how glad she had been to see Susan earlier that day 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o she said nothing.\line \line She cheered up quickly when the dwarf said my dear you most not know dwarves very well this is just the back door follow me. He led them\line 
all hunched over through a number of passageways and pulled out another key at what appeared to b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  another dead end in the cave wall.\line \line 
The key clicked and turned and they stepped inside the dwarf reached over and flipped a small switch and they saw they were at the foot of a stairwell hewn from the solid rock.\line the stairway was much longer then Elsie e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 x
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 pected and she realized she was they were climbing up the inside of the mountain itself.\line \line Like I said we came in the back door the actual place is higher up we are almost there.\line \line 
They were all still dead tired but it was warmer in here and there was no sn\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
w too so they all found strength to keep going up the long stone staircase. They stopped at a landing where the dwarf used another key to unlatch a steel gate. This one wasn't hidden but was a strong defense against any intruders that had made it this far
.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Finally they had reached the top and went through the last door. All the girls were completely amazed by the inside it was beautiful and elegant but also cozy they had stepped into a a staging area coats of amore and sword and axes were along one wall.
\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 They moved out if this room into a large and well furnished kitchen.\line \line Oh it's lovely gasped Elsie\line \line It would be lovier if there was food Susan joked.\line \line 
Ill get on that the drwaf said. This place is well stocked with food. Will feast like kings tonight.\line \line See\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ng the dwarf in the kitchen made him look even more fierce and warlike.\line 
\line He led them out of the kitchen to a beautiful dining room that had a table that would seat about 20 people (or drwaves)\line \line they then passed into a large gathering room elegantly decora\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ed and went up a flight of steps they walked over luxurious carpet and came to a small cozy hall with 5 doors. The dwarf opened one door to a small cozy room with a bed and a table and a large comfortable looking chair. He went over to a window and said
\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ou probably have had enough of snow but these rooms are actually on the eastern side and are built into the mountain precipice. He opened the window and they had a beautiful view of the valley far away in the distance. They also saw the snow had picked\~
 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  intensely and had turned into a blizzard\line \line 
Now for the best part the dwarf said. Each of these rooms has a bathroom with a luxurious bath. He opened the side door to a room with a bath. I started the heating furnace when I came in so you should be able to\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 take a hot bath any moment.\line \line 
Yay the girls all shouted nothing sounded nicer to Elsie at the moment. And ill be right back said the dwarf. The girls all laid down on the bed and Susan said I'm not sure i ever want to move again.\line \line I agree said Elsie, well 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o actually I disagree I think I could a manage to move into a hot bath.\line \line Elsie put her arm around Addie who was laying quietly she was awake but still looked rather pale and thin.
\line \line I'm glad we all found each other said Susan. Yes me too said Elsie it real\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y is lucky.\line \line 
At that moment the drwaf came in smiling broadly. I've brought some clothes normally dwarvish women would wear them but you can wear them while your wet clothes are drying.\line \line You can all take asking a bath as you want I am going to go down to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he kitchens and whip us up a meal fit for a fairy queen!\line \line I picture a fairly queen eating lettuce and maybe some water and light Elsie joked.\line \line 
Ok for for a drwaves warrior he joked back but if legends hold true\~ the fair folks magic was Only rivaled by th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ir cooking abilities.\line \line 
The dwarf left them and Elsie went to draw a bath for her and Addie will you be ok Addie she asked?\line \line Yes I'm feeling much better she replied and a warm bath will really helpline you could just help me to the bath.\line \line Yes of course sai
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  Susan and Elsie at the Same time.\line \line You can use the bath in this room so you wont have to walk as far.\line \line 
Elsie stripped off her wet and still mostly frozen clothes and settled into a hot bath she thought it was one of the nicest feelings she had ever exper\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
enced she sighed contentedly as the water warmed her body.\line 
she let the warm water soak over her and slowly warm her body. It was so comfortable she almost fell asleep but she caught herself and say up straighter. She couldn't believe how good the water fe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t as it slowly warmed every inch of her cold and tired body.\line \line As they warmed up they all began to realize how hungry they were.\line \line 
Addie finished first and she still felt weak but she felt much better she toweled off and put on a dress and blue sweater the \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
warf had brought her it fit better then she expected she tied a chord around her waist to make it fit a little better and she decided to go say hi to the drwarf\~ while she waited for her sisters.\line \line 
As she headed down stairs she was greeted with a delicious\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 smell of cooking.\line \line 
hello mr drwaf she said, that smells so good and also Thank you for carrying me all that way and for being brave and saving us from the bear.\line \line The dwarf was brave at facing most things but compliments were something he was not good with.
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  He got nervous and stammered into his beard it was nothing and besides he said I've carried a lunch sack that weighed more then you but will remedy that once my meal is done .\line \line Can I help you she said?\line \line 
Sure he replied you can peel these carrots.\line \line There \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
as a small wooden table with chairs around it and Addie sat down she had started to feel a little light headed and she took a minute to stabilize herself.\~ Are you ok the dwarf said noticing she seemed a little light headed.\line \line 
Yes I'm feeling much better s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e said a little tired but some food and sleep will do wonders.\line 
good well I think your going to like what I'm making, it's a good thing we keep this place so well stocked.\line \line \line Addie smiled\line \line well the dwarf said you all seem a lot less ferocious then when I fi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 st met you the dwarf laughed, he was busy stirring a pit and quickly moved over to a large mixing bowl.\line \line Oh Addie laughed ferocious? you must be teasing Elsie and I aren't exactly intimidating.\line \line 
Yes the dwarf said talking a meant off from his stirring\~ I \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 asn't excepting to find two young girls in so remote a place I thought for sure you were spirits or something darker.\line \line 
well we are just ordinary girls Addie laughed but how we got here is a strange story.\line \line I suspect as much said the dwarf. Well no worries\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
my plan is tonight we relax eat dinner and then rest by a fire we have all been through a lot. Then tomorrow when we are good and rested (and after a big breakfast of course) we can share stories and decide what our plan is.\line \line 
That sounds good Addie said a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  that moment Elsie walked in her dress was far to Long and she pulled it up as she walked\line \line 
Hi Addie she said she was so happy Addie was ok she went over sat right next to her putting an arm around her skinny shoulders.\line \line That smells good Elsie exclaimed wh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t are you making? I'm starving! Can you imagine if we were all still out in the snow? It would be awful how did you know about this place? We're you coming here on purpose\line She blurted out\line \line 
The dwarf waited patiently for her to finish all her questions. We\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l he laughed I'm making a lot if things or actually a feast and also dessert. It's a surprise though but it's almost done
\line \line oh please tell us tell us Elsie said\line \line Haha well if you can't wait I can tell you he said good naturedly.\line \line Elsie felt kind of guilty \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ind of like when you don't out what your present is supposed to be. She also realized the dwarf was very kind and she didnt want to take advantage actually she said we can wait ill try to guess by smelling things.\line \line That's a good game he said
\line \line I smell garl\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c Addie said and onions and I think maybe steak cooking I also smell raw carrots.\line \line 
You smell carrots Elsie asked I didn't know you could smell raw carrots Addie pointed over at the cooking area and said also I can see them and I helped cut them up.\line \line Oh El\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ie laughed
\line \line At that moment Susan came down she had taken longer then everyone else and she looked like she was going to a fancy party. (She got the nicest dress which gave her a bit of an advantage).\line \line 
You do know we are in the middle of no where Elsie tea\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed her, were you planning on steeping out tonight? Maybe gonna do the fox trot with the bear which seemed to take an interest in you.
\line \line Well if I remember right the dwarf mistook you for mountain trolls maybe if you\~ spent a little more time looking presen\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 able you wouldn't scare people. Susan retorted\line \line 
He didnt think we were trolls Elsie exclaimed he thought we were fairy folk which are known for their magic and Beauty right mr dwarf.\line \line Eh what's that the dwarf said pretending he hadnt heard so he wouldn't \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ave to take sides. He also opened the oven and pulled out a delicious looking loaf of golden bread it smelled delicious and set all their minds on food.\line \line We're just about ready to eat the dwarf said\line \line 
I can help set the table Susan offered oh I can help to\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  Elsie and Addie chimed in together.\line \line That would be just fine thank you the drwaf said.\line \line 
The girls said good night to th dwarf and headed towards their rooms upstairs\line \line The dwarf had doubt them some comfortable sleeping clothes which they put on. It's stra\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ge we are so high up and yet still underground Susan said.\line \line Yes I rather like being underground inside a mountain.\line \line And what luck we ran into such a kind dwarf if we hadnt we would have froze or starved to death.\line \line 
Its a good thing I'm so tired Susan said \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 therwise I don't think I'd sleep a wink. I feel like a have stumbled into a fairy take. A rather rough one given how forbidding those mountains are.
\line \line But there so beautiful Elsie said I don't think I've ever seen mountains so pretty and yes they are rugge\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  I feel we maybe be up for a rough trek out of here.\line \line 
Yes and I would imagine we would need to bring food and camp supplies I think he said its many days tell we would reach a city. And if it snows like it's doing now we would need to be well prepared.\line \line Y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s it would be a rough hike but the drawf seems very capable and he made his way up here ok with limited supplies so I think we can so it.\line \line What do you think Susan?\line \line Susan?\line \line \~Elsie said\line 
\line I think she fell asleep Addie laughed quietly it has been a rather he\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 tic day.\line \line Ill say Elsie replied\line \line 
Do you think you would rather be in an adventure or read about one Addie asked.\line \line Well right now being in one has been rather exciting but if we were still\~ outside in the snow I think I would say reading about one.\line \line Yes th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t what I think Elsie said also when you hear about an adventure the unpleasant situations are seldom as bad as when you have to experience them.\line \line 
I do hope we can find father soon Addie said\line \line Me too Elsie replied I'm sure we will, I miss mother a lot too \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ddie responded Elsie didn't respond for a little and Addie wondered if she had drifted off to sleep.\line \line 
Me too she finally said sometimes the sadness almost feels like more then I can bare. But I'm glad we have each other but i miss mother everyday she was \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
o pretty it's hard to talk about, but the wound never go away. I'm glad I have you and Susan and father is be lost without you.\line \line Madison\line \line \line \line 
she paused then went on and you need to stop scaring us if anyone else is going to get hurt or sick it's my turn it\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  rather selfish of you always making everyone else worry about you.\line 
\line Ok Addie replied I suppose I could\~ be a little less selfish I do tend to hog up all the sickness attention.\line \line Did you hear that Elsie asked her voice suddenly full of excitement and misc\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ief.\line \line I think so Addie replied stifling a giggle\line \line I'm pretty sure Susan just snored Elsie responded oh oh I do hope she does it again think of the fun we could have teasing her.\line \line 
I didn't know she was a snorer. That must be something new of think of the f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n we can have teasing her she whispered.\line \line 
Both girls lay still and breathless hoping Susan would make another noise.\line \line Eventually Elsie said disappointedly I think it was just a mumble\line \line Yes it's too bad Addie giggled\line \line Yes Susan's far to perfect Elsie said 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he must have some flaw we can use against her I mean besides being a pest who think shes Better then everyone else.\line \line 
Just at that moment Susan made a loud noise and rolled over she than began to snore loudly. Elsie and Addie began to giggle uncontrollably\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Addie stuffed a blanket in her mouth to keep from laughing out loud. While gasping for breath Elsie said do you remember friar he was so big he broke the wood on our couch\line \line yes Addie said I did feel bad for him he was so embarrassed\line \line 
Yes well I bet Susan \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nores\line louder then him father said he didn't sleep all night one time when he shared a room with him.\line 
Susan's snoring had changed a little but the girls where laughing to hard to notice.\line \line The next thing they knew something came flying out of the dark and l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
nded crash! Right on top of Elsie Addie and Elsie both screamed.\line \line 
there screams were stopped short by Susan's laughing "I heard you the whole time Elsie, you little monster! I woke up and heard you so I pretended to snore then I decided to attack you she \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
aid pinning Elsie down and ticking her. Addie had turned on the lights and all the girls lay laughing while Susan who still had Elsie pinned down and was sitting on top of her.\line \line Do you have anything you would like\line 
To say Susan asked clearly wanting an apo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ogy.\line \line Well yes Elsie said with feigned seriousness.\line \line 
That's more like it Susan responded with an air of dignity and waited for an apology. She was stil straddled over the top of Elsie sitting on her stomach and pinning her down.\line \line well elsie said I did mak\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  some comments about you being perfect and I'd like to say that then she blurted the last piece out in a rush that I was wrong your definitely\~
 not perfect I hadn't seen your wild bed head in a while and forgot just how terrible you look, your poor future\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 husband!\line \line 
Elsie! Susan began to tickle her again as she squirmed to get away.\line Elsie was surprised\~ how strong she was\~ and try as she might she couldnt get away. considering how graceful she was\line \line 
Your gonna end up a bar maiden in an old dirty bar serving \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
runk old sailors. And none if them will pay you any attention except when they want a drink and then theell say "hey you bar wench get me another ale" Susan said in her best sailor voice.\line \line 
you'll say we'll maybe the one with a patch on his eye and long di\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ty hairs not so bad he is only half drink but\line \line 
That was a pretty good impression Addie said yes Elsie chimed in you did sound pretty good.\line \line Susan sat waiting for Elsie to make another comment but Elsie didnt want to be ticked anymore so she held her tongu\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  and tried to look innocent.\line \line The girls continued talking for another hour or so and then they all drifted off to sleep.\line \line 
They woke up but it was difficult to tell what time it was. Elsie was the first to get up and she padded quietly to the bathroom not \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 anting to wake anyone else\line \line 
Is that you Elsie Susan whispered\line \line Yes it is Elsie said I think Addie's still asleep\line \line I made a breakfast fit for a king\line \line Oh where is it all three girls asked at once\line \line The dwarf leaned back and patter his belly\line 
\line What do you thin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  i have been doing for the last five hours he laughed\line \line 
Don't worry he laughed youve slept all the way into the afternoon and I (and my belly) didnt have the heart to wake you.\line \line Now before you think I'm a selfish glutton I thought we could have a light sna\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k and since it's 1 pm we can eat a small snack then go and expire the caves and mines then will have a magnificent dinner and figure out our plans.\line \line That sounds wonderful the girls\~
 all said. Their lunch was no too lift the dwarf had made some delicious b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ead and dispute what he said there was still plenty of food. He fried up more fresh sausage.\line \line 
We should explore he said. They went back out the backdoor and saw the deep snow coming down it looked like it hasn't stopped all night and when Elsie jumped in \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t it went up to her stomach.
\line \line And that said the drwaf is why we will stay inside today.\line \line It sure looks pretty Addie said.\line \line 
Yes it is the dwarf said. He paused as clearly a thought crossed his mind the girls except for Susan didnt notice but the dwarf knew\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he had to leave soon on a dangerous\~
 trip and travel a great distance.\line \line They went back inside already glad to be out of the bitter cold . Well the drwaf said cheerfully I was thinking if you feel up for it we could go explore the mines.\line Oh that sounds fun
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 they all said we would love to go exploring!\line \line They enter mines.\line \line 
the caves widened out considerably as they made there way down a smooth steep road. It was about 6 feet wide and the floor was perfectly smooth.\line \line the dwarf said I've talked to lots of humans\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 who say being by the ocean or in the woods or on a mountain makes them feel refreshed and joyful well for us dwarves give us a cave deep under ground.\line \line 
Susan followed up by saying but you must love the oceans and the forests and beautiful mountains?\line \line Yes \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he dwarf replied I do like them my mother always said we have a little fairy blood in our family line of course that's probably not true but we all do have a love for those things too, but all dwarves have a fierce desire for gems and gold and precious me
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 als, for the shaping and forging of armor and trinquets and weapons. We also love to be deep undergoing. But we are nothing compared to the deep dwarves.\line \line 
Oh what are the deep dwarves Susan asked?\line \line well they are dwarves but almost as different from us reg\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
lar dwarves as humans are from dwarves. They are smaller then us and much thicker. There also strong too for their size it's shocking how sting they are, there also very reclusive; they will almost never venture to the surface their terrified of it. Most 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
f what people know of them is from some of their explorers that have ventured to the sky world as they call it. There homes and mines are far below ours but they touch in a lot of places and there are a few cities and outposts at these places where a lot 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f trade\~ goes on.\line \line Are they friendly Addie asked?\line \line 
Oh yes said the dwarf but their also strange and fierce and they usually stick to themselves. One of the major trade cities deep underground is khelad zilkan. It's a lovely city and usually there are drwa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 v
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 es and deep dwarves all about there are even a fair amount of humans at times and Long long ago some of the fair folk would come down from time to time.\line \line Who are the fair folk Elsie said.\line 
they had been traveling a long ways through\~ massive caverns small \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
unnels broad roads but always deeper and the tunnels seed hopelessly intertwined and complex. now and Susan whispered to Elsie I hope we don't get lost but it echoed more loudly then she intended.\line \line 
Oh don't you worry the dwarf laughed if We get lost ill e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t my hat.\line \line 
Probably cause you'll have to cause will all be starving to death Elsie shot back then laughed at her joke the dwarf and everyone else also joined in.\line \line No the dwarf assured them that's one thing that I have noticed is different then humans dwar
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
es keep their bearings far better under ground then humans. That's not to say we don't get lost I could get lost down here if I was careless but this is a relatively small mine. It touches on natural caves and that is where even a drwaf could lose his way
.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 This is like how you might take an evening stroll near your home. You know how well your going you don't even really need to give it much thought.\line What natural caves do you mean Elsie said\line \line 
Oh there are huge underground places that are all natural they \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
tretch for hundreds and hundreds if miles. Usually dwarves will Incorporate them into their own cities. Are you familiar with dwarven cities he said?\line \line No not all all Susan replied\line \line 
Oh well their wonderful And some are More isolated but the larger ones are\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
usually built to take and tags of the massive natural caverns much of the deep dwarves domain is in these places. It's said you could get anywhere across the world inside of them but I don't know if that's true. There are some maps of some of the larger o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 es but there very incomplete and it's dangerously easy to become hopelessly lost.\line \line Even dwarves will take care when setting out on mining expeditions in these places.\line \line 
It's all very fascinating Susan said.\line \line Yes and of course when more for dwarves whose he\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rts are set aflame by the precious jewels and ores hidden beneath the surface.\line \line 
Of course there are dark and dangerous things beneath the surface too so you can't be foolhardy, but we won't speak of those while we are underground.\line \line They had come to a side\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
cavern that branched out on their left the jagged opening full of boulders and uneven rocks.\line \line Ok this will be a little rough going but if we go a little ways in it will be worth it. Do you feel like it.\line \line Oh yes we do Susan said\line 
\line Ya I agree plus it will ma\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e us hungry for dinner then we can eat Elsie laughed.\line \line 
they got back and all felt exhausted Elsie realized they probably weren't all the way recovered from the day before.\line \line The dwarf could tell they were tired so he said i can make us a fine dinner and yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r welcome to do what you want while I am cooking. The girls were all ravenously hungry so they said oh will wait while you cook we can help to if you want.\line \line 
Oh that's quite nice of you to offer but you all seem pretty worn out here he said and he brought \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n some comfortable chairs into the kitchen for them.\line \line Any suggestions he asked?
\line \line Well something warm Elsie said\line Yes some comfort food Susan laughed\line \line Ok I have just the thing e said and got to work.\line \line Addie and Elsie helped kneed the bread while Susan helpe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  chip things up.\line \line 
The dwarf got pounding busy pounding steaks flat and roasted them on a grill. He then took them out and filled them with a mixture that he had made that smelled delicious full of flavors and smells like garlic.\line \line He then carefully wrapped
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 each streak around the filling and placed them in the oven along with potatoes.\line \line Did you hear that Elsie said my stomach is saying it wants to eat.\line \line 
Well it's almost done the drwaf said cheerfully now we just wait but ill get some dessert going so we can \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ake that whole we are eating.\line \line Yay, I love dessert Addie said\line \line 
The girls and the dwarf ate every last bit if the dinner Elsie looked longingly back at the counter hoping she had missed something she still felt a little hungry but didnt want to be rude by \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
aying anything.\line \line Don't worry the dwarf said seeming to guess her thoughts. I have cocoa, fresh cookies and popcorn with chocolate and nuts that I made I wanted us to have room so we could enjoy dessert while we share out stores.\line \line 
Elsie sighed contentedly \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hat sounds just perfect.\line \line 
They all sat down in the small comfortable room in the giant seats they were all exhausted from their hikes so the warm fire and cocoa with cookies was the perfect ending to a long day. Elsie had insisted they all go jump in the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 now and it was dark and cold and the snow was even deeper. They were all feeling still chilled and even a little Hungry by the time they settled into their oversized chairs.\line \line 
Addie was so tiny she had curled up in hers like a cat and Susan covered her wit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a blanket.\line \line 
Look out Elsie Said as she plunged into the seat next to Susan cuddling up against her big sister.\line \line Susan pulled a blanket around both of them.\line \line 
Elsie realized she had dozed off she woke to the dwarf bringing a tray of fresh cookies. She spra\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
g out if her chair like it was on fire and then stood right next to the tray waiting politely for the dwarf to say she could take one.\line \line Oh please help yourselves take as many as you want I made plenty.\line \line 
I'd love to fill you all in but i don't\~ know how mu\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h you know He gave them a questioning look but he was far too polite to ask any direct questions about themselves.\line \line 
Elsie looked at Susan and they shared a look that seemed to say myles well tell him.\line \line Elsie decided telling him the full truth was probably\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
the best they could share what they know and see what he would think.\line she had some trepidation as to what he would think she didnt want him to think they were all crazy\line \line Well she started looking at Susan for help already.\line \line 
It's a bit of a strange story Su\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
an said. The mood seemed a little tense as both girls were reluctant to start. Luckily at that moment Addie was reaching for a cookie but she couldn't quite reach the table they were on, she was laying on the chair with Elsie and kept leaning forward when
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
crash! She fell off knocking the plate on top of her everyone laughed and luckily there were only two cookies left Addie got up laughing at her clumsiness does any one else want the other cookie she said her pretty\~
 pale white face a little red from embar\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 assment.\line \line Ill take the one with less blanket hair Elsie laughed\line \line 
Here ill to get some more the drwaf said does anyone want some more cocoa\line \line Oh yes please all three girls said at once\line \line great he said ill be back soon.\line \line I can help Carry things Susan said get\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ing up from her comfortable seat\line \line Oh thank you that's very nice of you the dwarf said.\line \line They were back shortly with a tray of cookies and and more hot cocoa.\line \line 
They settled in and Elsie felt more comfortable to tell their story.\line \line Well it's a bit strange sh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  said but I don't think we are from this world.\line \line 
What the drwaf said next made Elsie much more comfortable that he would believe them.\line He slapped his knew (nearly upsetting his cocoa) and said hah! I knew it, well I knew something was different about you!\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
So the old myths and legends are true there have always been stories of world walkers. And dwarves are generally shrewd and not easily tricked but when I first saw you all I just knew there was something unique.\line \line 
yes Susan said so we know nothing about y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ur world at all.\line \line Oh yes well I can fill you in on everything the dwarf said.\line 
but first are you planning to stay here, and did you have any reason for bein up in this mountain range?\line \line Well actually we were in danger and being chased in our world we stumbl\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
d into this world by accident but it wasn't a total accident out parents went missing and some scholars we talked to thought that they might have been taken to this world.\line \line 
But we just got here and it wasn't a hot day where we were but it was a warm fall \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ay and we were not dressed for this harsh climate. if we hadnt found you I'm sure we would al be dead from the cold.\line \line Yes it sure was lucky the dwarf said. Do you have any idea how to get back or how to search for your father?\line \line 
No I'm afrid we don't Elsie\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 said there were two men helping us and they knew more but for some reason they didnt make it.\line \line 
Yes I'm not surprised the dwarf said most of the ancients txts and legends say that world walking takes great magic I my powerful wizards, sorcerers or gods wer\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  rumored to have done it.\line 
\line At that moment Elsie went to take a sip of her cocoa but bumped the rim spilling some down her shirt. Well I can assure you she laughed we are none of those.\line \line Everyone laughed including the dwarf but he wasn't entirely convinced.\line 
\line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Well he said i think the best thing would be to speak with the Atlantans. They are ancient and very wise.\line \line 
The only bad thing is that i need to be at an important meeting and I was supposed to meet someone here but they haven't arrived\~ which makes me v\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ry concerned. I am going to search for them and also travel to the meeting but I am going to have to travel fast,\~ fast even for a dwarf. I think it will take about two weeks to get there and two weeks to get back.\line \line 
Are we coming with you Elsie asked?\line \line Th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 dwarf looked a little uncomfortable it was obvious he didn't want to be rude, Susan saw and interjected do you think we could keep up? How fast will you be traveling?\line \line Well he started trying to be carful that his words didnt offend.\line \line 
Ill be traveling wit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 two weeks of food, warm clothes and a tent and backup firewood so I don't starve it freeze to death. So I will be traveling with a heavy load, ill probably travel 18 hours a day. It's going to be rough but it's important I get there on time, the pace wil
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  be more leisurely on the way back. Have you had much conditioning for lot hikes?\line \line Not enough for that level Susan said\line \line 
Elsie looked disappointed but it was obvious she realized that Susan was right.\line \line The dwarf looked relieved but it was obvious he wante\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 to make sure things were ok, he was very kind hearted beneath his warlike exterior\line \line 
Your obviously all very spirited and I realize it is not fun to feel left out but there will be more adventure very soon and I don't know your past but I think this month\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
would be good for you to spend training and getting into condition.\line You will have plenty of good and you can explore the caves but don't be to adventurous they are very easy to get lost forever in.\line \line 
And actually that gives me an idea follow me.\line \line They all \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ot up out of their warm cozy chairs and followed him.\line 
they went out into the hall that led towards the underground caverns and into a side hall he uses a key to pass through a large metal gate. That gate is to keep people out if we were ever invaded dwarv\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s always build with security in mind which is why it's so hard to conquer or overtake a dwarven city. Of course this isn't a city but it still has many layers of defense. It's never been invaded or when attacked its relatively newer and so remote and hidd
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n its stayed quite safe.\line \line there were a few of the fair folk who knew about the place but we were peaceful with them and it was right around the time they all disappeared.\line \line 
It's a sad loss too.\line \line They had now entered a fairly large natural cavern. There wer\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 two small round stone towers here and a wall between them at the place where the cavern was the skinniest. A wall stretched between them with a study wooden gate enforced by metal bars.\line The two towers\~
 were about 30 feet high and the wall between them ab\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ut 20 feet high.\line \line This is the main entrance and where the place would be most susceptible to attack.\line \line 
Why didnt you build the wall farther up in the cavern where it's smaller and narrower Susan asked?\line \line Ah a good question he said the main reason is that th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 idea is that they wanted to be able to have room to shoot their crossbows and arrows and see their enemy.\line 
If they breached these walls we could retreat back to the smaller gates but then we couldn't really see the enemy or fight back. The other reason is\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
we are dwarves and mining and building is what we do. When this was built the dwarves were incredibly wealthy and powerful.\line \line 
They had preceded across the large expanse of the underground cavern and arrived at the tower on the left side it was hewn from la\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ge pieces of rock expertly placed together and reminded the girls of castles they had seen in England and France. It was also very different because it was only two towers and a wall deep beneath the ground. The wall between the towers was about 60 feet w
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 de.\line \line The dwarf used his key to unlock the wood door and they went in. the interior was about 15 feet with a staircase going up and also one going down.\line \line 
I wasn't expecting that Addie laughed as they went down the flight of steps!\line \line Me neither Elsie laughed\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 you dwarves sure are cleaver.\line \line 
Thank you the dwarf said clearly appreciative of the compliment. When they reached the bottom which was about twenty feet down they came too a large room full of beds and a small kitchen.\line \line Oh it's rather cozy Elsie said. The
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 dwarf opened a small door and here is the armory which is why I brought you all down here.\line \line 
The walls were covered in the most beautiful and intricate weapons and bows and armor Elsie and the girls had ever seen.\line \line Breathtaking she managed to say.\line \line Yes the\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e weapons and armor are of the finest craftsmanship and quite valuable. I want you all to be prepared if you meet another bear or something worse.\line \line 
Also while I am gone it will be good to practice wearing and marching in your armor so that your conditione\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 when we leave. It will be immensely uncomfortable at first but when you get used to it you will feel strange without it.\line \line 
Also ambushes have been more frequently of late and it will be a comfort to know that a stray arrow won't be nearly as deadly.\line \line He t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ok down a beautifully wrought piece of almost delicate looking chain mail. I think this will fit you he said as he handed it to Elsie.\line \line 
Oh goodness i was not expecting that! it's light she said as she took it from him, here feel this Susan she said handin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  the armor to her older sister.\line \line 
Oh my Susan laughed that is light how well does it protect you she said as she handed the armor to Addie to feel\line \line Oh don't you worry the dwarf said that is a very expensive piece that was cunningly made. It's actually quit
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  valuable and works better then most heavier armor\line \line Elsie slipped it on over her short\line \line you look quite dashing Susan said\line \line 
Do I look fierce Elsie said trying to scowl and not laugh at the same time.\line \line Addie giggled\line \line The dwarf was still inspecting pieces he\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e try this one on he said handing piece to Susan. Susan put it on but it felt a little loose.\line \line To big he said not to worry try these one he handed her another piece she put it on and it slipped on perfectly\line \line 
Oh you look beautiful Addie said\line \line Susan laughed\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
i don't want to look beautiful I want to look fierce like Elsie she pulled a serious face and Elsie said hey that's pretty good you could definitely scare something\line \line Something? Susan responded something as in what?\line \line 
Oh maybe a small cat or a timid chicken.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Everyone laughed\line \line The Elsie said well actually you do look pretty fierce like a warrior maiden.\line \line 
The dwarf handed a small delicate looking piece to Addie who tried it on and found it for perfectly.\line \line Oh you look adorable Elsie said going her little siste\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a big Hug.\line \line 
Thank you Addie said Hugging Elsie back. Oh but I do think I prefer hugs wothout armor on.\line \line The dwarve gave each of the girls a sword a dagger a bow and Susan also got a spear. He also gave them widen training spears and light helmets that fi
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  under a hood.\line \line The girls looked at the larger dwarven helmets that were grotesquely and hideously fashioned.\line 
The dwarves have a tradition of fashioning their helmets to be as scary as possible. All except for zeeel the rabbit. During the great goblin and\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
human wars he fashioned his helmet like a cute bunny. He would even paint it. He was so feirce and\~ deadly that soon the enemy would flee at the site of his mask.\line \line Interesting Susan said.\line \line 
I don't like arming people but the world is much more wild and dan\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
erous now then it's been in a long time. Hopefully there will be no need to use any of these things but it will make me glad to know that you have some protection.\line \line 
It was getting late but the dwarf wanted to show them the basics of sword craft and how to\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 practice.\line \line 
They left the courtyard and went back to the area behind the wall and towers where he showed them an archery range and targets and also posts on which to practice sword strokes.\line \line You can also practice with each other but make sure you wear your
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
armor and don't hurt each other. He then showed them some basic defensive moves how to thrust parry and slash. They practiced on the wood posts and then practiced with him he was an expert teacher and the girls were shocked how quick he was. And whole he 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 as a good teacher he was very gentle the girls were safer then if they were playing with a puppy. He then showed them the basics of archery and recommended they spend their time at that.\line 
\line The nice part of archery is you can use it to hint and keep your op\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 onents at bay.\line \line 
I'm going I be gone about five weeks he said when I get back I will rest up and then I plan to hike us out of here. It will be dangerous and also a rugged and exhausting trip and we will all have to do it with our weapons and packs. I thin
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  a month should be a good amount of time to get conditioned if you go outside though be careful the mountains are treacherous and you can quickly find yourself in whiteout conditions.\line 
\line I actually wouldn't recommend you go far but you could practice hiking\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
up the sheltered path that leads here. It's steep and has deep snow and if you hike up and down it once that would be a very good work out.\line \line 
You can also practice your weapons skills. I also think it will help you fight off boredom. Some other things you \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
an do would be to practice your cooking and have fun making meals, there are a few books I will show you and also there are some games you will enjoy.\line \line 
Thank you Susan said I'm sure will be fine you'll come back to find sword maidens she said with a smile.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Good he laughed and I never want to encourage anyone to fight or Become a warrior but it's good to be able to defend yourself.\line \line 
Oh and one other thing you can explore the caves just don't get lost down there. It would be best to do small trips and be aw\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
re of whats around you then slowly venture out. The start of this cave is less complicated then many caves. All the same about a mile in it starts to get much more complicated so you would want to be careful.\line \line 
After they finished archery practice and swor\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 drills they headed back up to the main front room and settled back into their comfortable seats. They were exhausted now and all felt a little hungry. The dwarf went and got some more cookies and cocoa for everyone and they cuddled into blankets in their
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 chairs and relaxed. They also lit a large fire which helped even further to warm them up.\line \line 
I have to leave tomorrow. Ill be leaving early but I feel you will all be well prepared while I am gone. You have enough food to last a couple of years so help your\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
elves and have fun cooking and trying out new things.\line \line Also when I come back will probably have a rather difficult hike out so it would be good to get into good shape and spend time practicing archery and your swordsmanship.\line \line 
The girls were all sad and re\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 uctant to see him go and Elsie still wanted to go along with him but she knew he was right.\line \line 
The dwarf said I am sorry I can't bring you this time but this is going to be a very dangerous and rigorous trip. I think by this time tomorrow if I did let you c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
me you would all be regretting it and wishing you were warm and safe and comfortable back here.\line \line We like it here Addie said I'm sure it will be fun but we will miss you\line \line 
Yes Susan agreed we will practice and be ready when you come back.\line \line Good said the drw\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rf then when we hike out we can take it easier then hopefully.\line \line 
We will miss you Elsie said and do be careful your self.\line \line Oh I will dont you worry he responded. I'm going a little out of my way to avoid the goblin infested parts of these mountains.\line \line The g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 rls decided to explore the caves. We should pretend were on an adventure Elsie said.\line \line Well we kind of our on an adventure I'm not sure we need to do any pretending.\line \line 
That is a very good point Elsie said and come to think of it as we explore the caves I do\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
't think I would want any more adventure, I mean isn't most adventure getting lost or fighting something\line or finding lost treasure Susan interjected\line \line That kind if adventure I could handle Elsie laughed\line \line 
Yes Susan said its definitely not\~ sitting on a couch\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 sitting on a couch\~ junk food.\line \line 
That's true Elsie laughed all though wait a minute we have been doing a lot of sitting in comfortable chairs and eating and we are most decidedly on an adventure.\line That's a good point Susan said\line \line I like the point about treas
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 re Addie added.\line \line yes we should look for gold Elsie said!\line \line What does gold look like said Susan?\line \line 
Well, it kinda looks like the color gold I wild imagine Elsie laughed.\line \line Yes but I mean in a mine is it mixed in with oar\line \line Hmm I'm not sure said Elsie\line \line We can j\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
st look for anything that we think is gold.\line \line the girls spent the afternoon exploring the caves but they did not go in very far they didnt want to get lost. They came back exhausted but decided to go look at the snow, so they trudged tiredly\~
 up to the bac\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  door and went outside. It was getting dark and a gentle blanket of snow was slowly covering the evening world.\line \line 
Just think Elsie said that poor dwarf is out in this weather.\line \line I know Susan replied, he is very capable so I'm sure he is safe but I doubt he \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s very comfortable or warm.\line \line 
Even though Susan said that she was a little concerned for his safety as were all the girls.\line \line Well we should make dinner and a nice dessert. That sounds lovely said Addie. They ended up making fresh bread, steak and for desser
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  they\line made cinnamon roles\line \line \line after dinner they relaxed and curled up on the soft carpet\~ in front of a warm fire and talked together.\line \line 
Well we didnt find any gold Elsie said\line And we also didnt die or get lost and considering we got in better shape I'd say i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 was a good day. They all tool hot baths before they settled into they cozy beds. They had brought a third bed in and all slept in the same room together.\line \line 
They spent each say practicing at archery and swordsmanship. They also went on longer and longer hi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
es in the caves and would hike to the bottom of the snowy trail that led up to the entrance to the dwarven cave.\line \line Each day they would push themselves a little more and were all excited at the progress they were making.\line \line 
The days quickly flew by and turned\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 to weeks.\line \line 
as Time ticked by still there still was no sign of him. It had been six weeks and the girls knew he had said four weeks. After the first storm things had been relatively calm but lately winter had come on in fill force, everyday the girls would
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hike outside to her in better shape but the fierceness of the mountains winter storms had made it almost impossible to go out. But the last two weeks had been relatively clear and they felt sure he should have been back by now.\line \line 
I bet he just got delayed \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y the snow or maybe he realized that it would be dangerous and decided to wait.\line \line 
Yes I hope so Elsie said but deep inside something worried her that something had gone wrong. Addie and Susan felt the same way.\line \line I think we should go out and look for him El\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ie said you know he would do that for us.\line \line 
Yes he would but I feel he knows more about mountain travel then we do. I don't know how we could even find our way back here. And think how sad he would be if be headed back in the spring and found our lonely bo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 es on the mountains laying in the summer grass.\line \line Yes that's true, what do you think Addie?\line \line 
Well she said I think we should keep exploring the caves and practicing our archer and swordsmanship and then plan to set out in the spring, she paused then said w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 enever that might be.\line 
\line They made vegetable soup with need broth and drag baked bread for dinner. After they had cleaned up they sat in their warm comfortable chairs sipping cocoa by the warm fire that Susan had made.\line \line You sure are getting amazing at makin
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  cocoa Susan said to Addie.\line \line Oh thank you Addie laughed I like doing it and the cocoa they have hear is quite amazing,\line \line I bet it's expensive Elsie mused,\line \line 
Ya Susan replied cocoa is only grown in warm areas and I am sure anywhere warm is far far from here.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Susan yawned sleepily, well I'm gonna go get some more cocoa does anyone want some?\line \line 
Yes please both the other girls chimed in.\line \line The girls hasn't waited very long when Susan burst back in the room and slammed and locked it shut.\line \line Elsie was jolted out of \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
er peaceful reverie with a tinge of fear.\line \line What's up su she said with a nervous voice.\line Someone's down there she whispered someone came in and there Hooded in a black cloak and wearing all black.\line \line 
Maybe it's the dwarf Addie said hopefully.\line \line No not unless h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  has grown and gotten much thinner.\line \line All the girls were standing now.\line \line 
I'm sure she saw me too Susan said. I was so scared and I bolted up here.\line \line Susan's face was white and so were the other girls.\line \line Oh no what well we do Elsie said clutching Addie. We lef\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  all our weapons down stairs I can believe we were so foolish.\line \line Well we thought we were safe here . I mean everybody is locked and bolted you saw how hard it is to get in. Susan whispered.\line \line 
Oh no Elsie groaned quietly.\line \line What is it Susan said.\line \line I hope they\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
didnt take the key from the dwarf. All the girls felt even sicker at that thought if it were possible considering how worried they were.\line \line 
Well Susan said gliding silently over to the fire and picking up the fire poker. She handed it to Elsie and face Addi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 a small log and she grabbed one that was burning at one end out of the fire.\line \line Elsie could tell she was still nervous and Ashen faced but she had a steely. Resolve about her now.\line \line 
Should I hide behind the door and hit him when he comes in Elsie asked?\line \line Ye\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  I think that's a good idea Susan said.\line \line what of it is a friend though Addie\~ said.\line \line 
Hmm Susan thought pensively well here is what will do ill hide behind the door and if they seem dangerous ill git them in the head. Ok we should trade weapons then Elsie \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
aid handing the medal fire rod to Susan who went and hid where the door opens.\line \line They all felt a little braver now that they had a plan. However those feelings were about to go quickly away as bang bang bang someone knocked roughly on the door.
\line \line Elsie felt\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 her knees go weak but she stood firm an tried to look brave. Susan out her finger to her lips wanting them not to make any sound.\line \line 
A second later they heard the worse sound they could imagine as at hey heard a key slide into the lock, click and turn.\line \line The\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
door creaked slowly open and Elsie felt she was going to pass out from fear her shacking knees made it hard to stand.\line \line The person entering and the girls were all about to be in for a very big surprise.\line \line 
The cloaked stranger was shocked to see two small gi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ls but also sensed the presence of someone else.\line \line 
Why your just girls one of the most beautiful voices they had ever heard came out of the dark cloak.\line almost at the same time the girls said, your a girl!\line \line They all still felt the stranger could be dangerou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 but she said again in her beautiful voice please step out from behit the door and ill come in. I don't want to hurt you if you truly are just girls. But who are you and what are you doing her and how did you get and how did you get in, are you with anyon
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  else. She rattled off the questions in a quick succession.\line \line Elsie stepped timidly out fe behind the door still holding the medal poker.\line \line 
The stranger threw back her clock and the girls gasped it was not what they were expecting.\line \line Your beautiful Elsie sai\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  quietly.\line 
and she was she had perfect features and blind hair. She was also much younger looking then they expected. She looked like she was about college age.\line she looks like mother Addie whispered to Susan and Elsie.\line \line 
Why thank you the stranger laughed.\line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 S\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he had a nice kind laugh and the girls felt completely disarmed around her.\line \line 
Wait a minute said firmly remembering when she had met the dwarf. How do we know your no a ghost or a spirit.\line \line Well I suppose you don't she smiled but then again how do I know yo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
r not.\line \line Elsie bit her lip not quite sure what to say.\line \line 
You can call me Hannah the girl said. Is that cocoa she looked longingly at the cup. Susan realized now after the fright that she looked cold and tired. Here please sit down Susan said are you hungry?\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Will go get you some food.\line \line Oh I would love that she said. And while we are eating we can trade stories?\line \line As they left Hannah slowly undid her cloak and loosened her sword.\line \line 
I think we can trust her Elsie said\line \line Me too agreed Addie\line \line Yes Susan said actually\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 I was thinking she reminded me of mother.\line \line 
I thought the same thing Addie and Elsie responded. Very pretty and kind.\line \line Yes she is very beautiful Susan said, not someone you expect to see breaking into your house.\line \line Well she did have a key Elsie laughed so m
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ybe she didnt break in after all.\line \line I thought she reminded me of a fashion model. Susan said\line \line Yes she is rather stylish looking even in a black traveling cloak.\line \line 
But do you think we can trust her Elsie said?\line \line Hmm Susan pondered well do we have a choice? We\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 can't exactly ask her to leave and go sleep in the snow.\line \line 
Ya that wouldn't work so good Elsie said. I hope we can trust her I mean she seemed so nice.\line \line Yes Addie agreed I liked her she seems nice like mother was.\line \line When they got back to the room she had fa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
len asleep. She looked even prettier the girls all thought, she is younger looking then I realized Susan whispered not wanting to wake her. She woke up though and smiled at the girls. Sorry about that she laughed I must have drifted off I have had little 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 leep for days and not much food either. Is zz here she asked? I was supposed to meet him. Oh no he was supposed to be back Elsie said but we don't know where he is we have all been concerned.
\line \line A look of worry passed over hleys face. Oh that's not told she\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 said. He is very capable I do hope he is ok.\line \line \line 
We brought you some food Elsie said and Susan handed her some of the beef stew and bread they had made for dinner.\line \line Oh thank you she said and began to eat, who made this she managed to say through mouthfuls i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 's delicious. Oh we all did but Addie did the spices and flavoring.\line \line Oh well it's amazing she said. I haven't had a meal this good in a while.\line 
When she had finished eating the girls brought out cocoa and cookies. As they were going down to the kitchen to \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
et them Elsie said she is so beautiful and elegant she reminds me of a princess, well a not spoiled princess she laughed. I feel like we can trust her to Susan said, what do you think Addie?\line \line 
Well she liked my food so I say yes we can trust her and laughe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 I'm not sure that's the best way to judge\~ pretty sure ... Would like your food.\line \line 
As they brought the cookies and cocoa up the settled into the warm couches by the fire Addie gave Haley a blanket and she cuddled up in it. Thank you girls for your hospi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ality she said. If you want I could fix us breakfast tomorrow?\line \line Oh that would be nice Susan said.\line \line Also if I'm not prying I'm curious how you ended up in such a remote location?\line \line 
The girls all looked at each other reluctant and insure how much to reveal.\line \line \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Haley was very perceptive and saw the look, she quickly said its ok of your reluctant we can talk abou something else.\line \line 
Well Elsie said I would be ok talking about it by you might not believe us?\line \line Well I'm a fairly open person Haley said I would like to h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
pe that I'm not gullible but all of you girls seem trustworthy.\line \line 
Well Elsie said there are some people who think that I make up stories and here she looked over at Susan, Susan jumped in, well I think in light of present circumstances I'm much more likely\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
to agree with you then not and she smiled and also Susan followed up with who would believe that I got chased by a bear and lived!\line That is true Elsie laughed.\line 
Well anyways Elsie went on were not totally sure how we got here we sort of stumbled into wherev\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r it is we are.\line \line 
When we got here we were in the range of mountains and that's when we stumbled upon the dwarf who so kindly helped us all.\line \line They were all getting ready for bed when Addie said should we see if she wants sleep in here.\line \line 
I wouldn't mind Els\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e said.\line \line They sat around talking and the girls told her how they were leaning swordsmanship and archery. Oh we can practice together if you like\~
 not the best she said but know a few tricks and she smiled. Oh that would be lovely Susan said and Elsie and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ddie both agreed.\line \line 
So Haley said it sounds like your bit totally sure where you are and your also looking for your father. There is a large counsel taking place and I am planning to leave for it. I was thinking we could spend a few more data here and get 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ll of our supplies ready then head out. It will be a difficult joinery but the wizards are very wise and I think they could help you.\line \line 
I think they also would be able to understand works walkers better.\line \line Are you familiar with where we are she said? This p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ace is not very inhabited.\line \line 
The next day try woke up and went and had breakfast then practiced swordsmanship and went on a hike outside. It was overcast but not too snowy and they made it a little farther then headed back.\line \line I like it hear Susan said its c
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 zy all tucked away in our little fort. Me too Addie said.\line \line 
They made dinner and that night all sat up in the room talking, Haley said well I am planning to join the counsel. It's a couple weeks traveling from here. I think it would be good for you girls i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 you joined but feel free to do what your comfortable with. It would be a little safer and easier to make the journey during mid summer but that's many months from now but the journey will be difficult so do what you think is right. I am afrid that things
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 have been gettin steadily worse and we might not have safety like we used to have for many years.\line \line 
Elsie looked at Susan and Addie and their looks seemed to agree with what Elsie was thinking.\line \line I think we would like to go with you, right? She queued the o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 her two girls.\line \line 
Yes they both agreed.\line \line Oh good Haley said. She looked relieved and said "I feel like we all get along really well so it will be nice having you all along. I think will plan to leave in 3 days if that works for you?\line \line 
Yep sounds great Elsie \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 aid, though ill miss this place and the food!\line \line yes will let's live it up while we still can Haley laughed.\line \line 
The next morning they all explored the caves and then winded their way up to look at the outdoors. It was overcast but the snow was not as bad and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 hey decided they would leave in two days.
\line \line They went back in and made steak soup and fresh bread and an apple pie for dessert.\line \line Exhausted after the day they settled into their nice comfortable chairs by the fire for the evening. Would you like to spend th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  night with us tonight Elsie asked.\line Yes you should Addie said, we won't talk to much.\line \line Oh I would love that Haley said.\line \line 
Will all be sleeping together in a tent soon Susan laughed so We might as well get used to it.\line \line Susan snores like a giant lumberjack E\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 sie laughed.\line \line 
I do not Susan replied to both Elsie and Haley going a little red in the face.\line \~well I can sleep through anything Haley laughed.\line \line ok Elsie said I have b idea whoever is a snorer has to be on guard duty.\line \line 
the girls were all excited they had s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ent the last day packing and were leaving. Haley was a laid back traveler so far they had slept in, made breakfast and were just now getting ready to leave. It still was fairly early but Elsie was glad she felt normal she had never liked gettin up to earl
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  for trips it made her feel weird the whole day.\line \line Ill be sad to leave this place Susan said. It's nice and comfortable and feels a little but like home now.\line 
yes I've always really enjoyed it here, Haley replied. I have been here twice and both times reall\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 enjoyed it. Maybe will get a chance to visit the great dwarf cities in the birth. They are absolutely amazing and gigantic. But they are nice when you get used to them. They all headed up to the entrance\~
 and locked it securely before setting out with pa\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ks full of supplies blankets tents and other things. Elsie had tried to pick up Haley's lack and was surprised how heavy it was. She couldn't barely lift it. Are you sure you can carry all that Elsie said? Oh yes I'm used to heavy packs Haley laughed.
\line \line lu\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 kily they all had snow shoes which made it much easier to travel across the snow. They set out down the windy path out of the valley. One good thing is that most of the trip\~
 wil be more or less downhill.\line \line Oh that is nice Elsie said.\line \line Also when we get out\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 of the snow will travel through beautiful mountains and forests.\line \line 
They traveled for about a week through the mountain passes. Always more or less heading downwards. They passed many amazing views as they traveled. At first all they saw were rugged snow ca\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ped peaks. As they traveled further they started to spot mountain peaks in the distance that looked a little less white. The heavy snow around them also began to be less thick.\line \line 
Then one day as they were walkin Addie exclaimed oh look up ahead grass I see\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
some green grass! Yay they all cheered, snow is a lovely thing but it doesn't make for a good traveling companion unless your being pulled in a sled to someplace warm. Even then if you don't have a warm destination to get to by the end of the night it can
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 become rather unpleasant, though lovely to look at or to spend an afternoon playing outside in.\line \line 
That night when they stopped for camp the evening air felt a little warmer (though still not warm enough).\line \line They quickly set about their evening tasks, usuall\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 two people would work on setting up the tent and camp one person would gather firewood and one person would cook.\line Elsie was getting better at cooking but she had a tendency to burn or undercook everything.\line \~
when she had almost burned the dinner the night\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 before Susan had caught her. Fathers right she has said with a laugh you don't have a very long attention span.\line \line 
But tonight Addie was cooking and she was very good. She also was a quick Learner from Haley about cooling over an open fire which is much dif\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 erent then cooking in a nice kitchen.\line \line 
Addie was busy preparing a small loaf of bread and planned to warm up some of the meat they had left.\line \line as They made camp there was a bright crescent moon that hung over the mountains and a few pale clouds illuminated
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 against the dark colors of the swiftly fading sky. The smell of the camp fire was good as it filled the air around their little camp.\line \line 
After they had eaten they all say around the fire talking. They were getting in better shape and their bodies felt less \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 xhausted and sore as they had the first couple nights.\line \line 
We should tell scary stories Elsie said!\line \line That is a terrible idea Susan replied, you do realize we are out in the middle of the wild in dark woods in the middle of the night.\line \line Oh fine, Elsie said you\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 wouldn't want to tell scary stories if we were sitting on a crowded beach in the sunshine.\line All though Elsie said with a mischievous smile after pausing if we were about to swim id probably\~
 wanna tell stories about sharks she said. SHark she yelled as she\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 lunged at susan with her mouth open.\line \line 
Susan caught her and rolled over on top of her Elsie was laughing to much to fight back so Susan pinned her down.\line \line Does the shark like to eat dirt Susan laughed dangling a handful over her face.\line \line You wouldn't Elsie sa
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d indignantly as she began to squirm.\line \line Susan opened her hand and elsie shrieked.\line \line Something hit her face.\line \line Haha Susan laughed it was just a piece of meat.\line 
\line Sharks like meat Elsie said vending her head and taking a bite out of it.\line Eventually Susan let Elsi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  back up.\line \line 
Haley was smiling she enjoyed being around the spirited girls and even though they liked to tease each other it was obvious how much thu all loved each other. Haley though that love was almost not strong enough word for how they treated Addie t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ey adored their little sister.\line \line 
As they settled around the campfire with cups of warm cocoa Haley told them about where they were. The whole place she said is fairly uninhibited. Which is why we don't need to be as cautious about safety as we will later. \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 T
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he only place where humans live is on the western coast and even there I don't think there are a lot of cities. I haven't been that way in a whole so things very well might have changed.\line \line 
What do you mean by humans Susan asked.\line \line Oh Haley said then paused \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ell there are not many dwarven settlements or other civilized creatures.\line \line 
Oh Susan said do dwarves live here?\line \line Yes Haley said they have some if there smaller cities far in the north but there great empires lie over the seas to the far to the west. That is\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
where many humans live and in the great continents far to the south.\line \line What are those like Elsie asked?\line \line Oh they are wild I have never been but I heard they are full of deep jungles and strange creatures.\line \line \line 
Has where we are ever been very inhabited Elsie a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ked.\line \line All the girls thought they noticed a brief look of sadness pass over her face.\line \line 
Yes long ago the fair folk lived here. Humans called them elves but they have all disappeared she said sadly.\line \line You can still find Some of their overgrown cities amongst \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he woods.
\line \line Oh my Susan said have you ever been to one?\line \line Yes i have seen a lot of them she replied even though they are overgrown they are still\~ quite lovely. But they can feel a little sad.\line \line 
What are they like Elsie asked? Well there are all different ki\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ds. Some of them are made from white stone, some of them were built in trees. They always blended in well but now over the years they have become a part of the land.\line \line How long ago Did they disappear Addie asked\line \line 
It's been a long time she said over 300 Yea\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s.\line \line Oh wow well I hope we get to see one Elsie said. Yes all the other girls agreed.\line \line 
The next morning they woke up and packed up the camp. The day was there most enjoyable day of travel yet. The snow was almost all gone and they spent the day walking thr\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ugh beautiful pine and fir and ash woods.\line \line They spotted fast flowing mountain steams tumbling down the hills.\line \line Pretty soon Haley said we are going to have to cross one of them and unfortunately it's doing to be terribly\~ \~
cold. Most of these mountain stre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ms are snow Melt and they are always cold and can be quite swift. The one we will have to cross is about knew deep I am making to a place where the river will be widest so that it will be shallow but to be careful will string a rope across.\line \line 
Will probably\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 go slowly and string a rope across the River to be safe.\line \line 
Ill also go first and make a fire on the other side in case anyone falls in the cold can be deadly. We should get there about dusk so we can camp in the far side of the river.\line \line The girls all agreed\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 this was a good plan.\line \line 
They continued hiking the foresty hills were rigged and at points the think undergrowth was a struggle to get through but Haley was a skilled pathfinder and they managed to stay on clear ground.\line \line Eventually they came out from the tr
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 es to the bank of a swift flowing river.\line \line \line Brr that looks cold said Elsie.\line \line 
It is Haley laughed I wish we could go around it but that woul take months. We arrived at a good spot from here we just need to head upstream a little. It was a but tricky heading\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
up stream because the bank was overgrown but eventually they made it to a place where the river was fairly wide. It was still swift though.\line \line 
Ok Haley said its deeper then I expected so will have to be careful. I think that I will tie a rope around my wais\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 then you girls can secure it and pull me back if the current is to strong. I can go first and build a fire then warm we can get everyone else across and make sure that can get warmed.\line \line 
Ahh Haley let out a small squell as she stepped in. It's cold all rig\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t she said. The girls kept a right hold on the rope and also tied one end around a tree.\line \~
She waded bravely forward and at one point the water came up to her waist. She stumbled and the girls yelled encouragement she finally made it shivering and cold. Sh\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 stripped off her wet clothes and put warm ones on and wrapped in a blanket as she started a fire.\line \line Are you ok Susan yelled across the river banks.\line \line Yes Haley yelled back her voice shacking from the cold.\line \line 
Once she got the fire going she yelled back I'm g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nna come back and help you girls across its deeper and swifter then I remember.\line \line 
Elsie yelled back no you don't have to so that you will freeze! I'm ok she yelled as she plunged back in the river.\line \line She is too nice Elsie said\line \line I know I agree Susan and Addi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  bother agreed.\line \line Haley came back over and fought the strong current. She was shivering with cold when she made it.\line \line Are you sure you should do this Elsie asked with concern in her voice.\line \line 
Yes Susan added in as she handed her a blanket we don't want you to\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 get to cold!\line \line 
No it's ok she said we can just hurry and get it over the river is really swift and ill feel better If I know I helped you get across. Who wants to go next?\line \line The girls all looked at each other. I guess I can try it next Elsie said.\line \line 
Ok Haley\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 said just hold on to the rope we strung across and ill help guide you to.\line \line Ready? Haley said.\line \line 
Yep lets do this, Elsie gritted her teeth and stepped into the water. She was barefoot because she didnt want to her her feet wet.\line \line The cold water was a complet\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 shock oh my she gasped out.\line Yes it's cold Haley said. Once we are across you can snuggle in a blanket by the fire.\line \line 
They made it about 15 feet when Elsie lost her balance as the river abruptly fell the water rose up to above her waist and she felt her se\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
f going numb with the shock of cold water. The current was also strong and she felt her feet being swept from under her. She felt her legs\line swept from under her and stumbled under the water it happened so fast\~
 and she lost hold of the rope. At that moment\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Haley's strain arms grabbed her and steadied her. I got you she yelled over the loud torrent threatening to drown their voices out.\line \line 
Elsie felt her body going numb and the feeling going away in her bare feet. She stumbled clumsily and felt Haley's strong \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rms steady her. The water was almost up to her chest and she felt Almost dizzy from the rushing water and it's tremendous pressure and also the loud noise. The water felt angry like I wanted to hold her head under and watch as she drowned. She kept moving
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 forward one foot at a time and was greatly helped by Haley.she realized\~ Haley\line was singing a gentle song and she felt more strength.\line \line 
finally they had made it and she stumbled out dripping wet into the rocky bank. She clambered fully out of the water and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ave Haley a wet hug.\line \~
thank you she said through shivering teeth. She felt her whole body shivering almost convulsively. There was a wind that are right through her clothes and chilled her to the bone.\line \line they both staggered to the fire and the warmth felt 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 elicious. If you want you can change into something warmer and wrap up by the fire with a blanket.\line \line 
Ok I will Elsie said. Are you sure your going to be ok she asked, worrie about Haley.\line \line Yes ill just think about how nice it will be to be warm soon. She sm\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
led a weak smile and plunged back into\line the river.\line \line 
Elsie sat by the fIre with a blanket wrapped around her watching. She was worried for Haley and hopes that they would all be safe and warm soon. She rummages he cold and numb fingers though the packs and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ound cocoa, she then for some water and put it on so that they would have something warm to drink. Haley started back across with Addie perched on her back. They struggled across then she for Susan.\line \line 
Haley looked so exhausted and tired from the three trip\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
. Ill make dinner tonight Elsie said you should reset and get warm by the fire. Elsie cooled some bread and they all sat huddled by the fire while it was warming up.\line \line Who wants to swim in the river tonight Susan joked.\line \line 
Oh me Elsie said with a laugh.\line \line Tha\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  was cold Haley said I'm sorry we had to do that. There really is no other way around the river.\line \line Thanks for carrying me Addie said.
\line \line Yes hour welcome I think it would have been too deep for you.\line \line I wish we were all snug in our beds back up in the mountai\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s Susan said. Yes that would be nice tonight an a hot bath.\line \line At least we have a nice warm tent and blankets that we can snuggle up in Elsie said pulling the blankets tighter around her.\line \line Yes Addie said and\line \line 
Good night Susan I love you\~ night Addie\line \line Good n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ght Haley love you, errr Elsie paused I mean I like you. There was another pause then everyone burst out laughing.\line 
Should I be offended Haley teased\line \line No no I'm sorry Elsie laughed.\line \line I mean I loved the warm bread we had for inner so I guess I can say I lov\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  you.\line 
Love is a strange word. What I mean is that you feel like family it just sort of slipped out.\line \line Well you do to Haley laughed. I suppose sleeping together in a tent will do that.\line \line 
They see out and it felt like they were walking through a dream. Waterf\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 lls and small creeks fell from pine clad hills.\line \line 
Overall the terrain was fairly rugged and mountainous. After days and days of hiking through the mountains they they reached much gentler forested hills. They finally came to a small dirt path.\line \line it was a ni\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e evening as they winded their way through the shadows. The warm night air was pleasant and their feet crunched on the fallen autumn leaves through the branches of the beech and alder and oaks and pines they caught glimpses of the stars far overhead. Afte
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 a whole the trees opened and they were walking through soft grass tall trees spread out around them but they grew far enough apart they caught more glimpses of the night sky a rich shade of dark blue.\line \line \line 
It had rained that day but the clouds had started t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  give way as dusk fell swiftly.\line \line 
The stars came out bright and clear faint moonlight illuminated the scatters clouds that still lingered across the night sky.\line \line The night air smelled fresh as they quietly winded there way through the forest and trees. The 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 all pine and for trees stood silently like dark specters.\line \line \line Steep\~
 mountains steep and rocky and impregnable. Pine and fir and evergreen trees grew in places where the ground was gentle enough to support them. They also caught glimpses of what looked like\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
aspen trees high up in the mountains.\line \line 
This is the same range we were in earlier we could have gotten here by traveling north through the mountains but it would have taken many years if we ever could make it at all. The storms further can be sudden and vi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 lent.\line \line Now we will continue north and at some point we should hit a small road that leads to the city. There aren't ma y farms or people around here most of them live father north and west of here.\line \line 
Years? Addie asked\line \line well not actually Years Haley laughe\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 but a very very long time you would be constantly trying to scale massive icy peaks of snow and rock and climb and descend cliffs. Of course there are paths and areas where the mountains are less steep but most people that cross the mountains do so acros
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  them.\line \line 
event then it's still not very populated. Long ago only fair folk loved here but it was always mostly oceans and woodlands and mountains. The city we are going to was built by the fair folk but when they disappeared humans took it over.\line \line Steep\~
 mo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ntains rose rocky and impregnable on their right hand side as they continued north. Pine and fir and evergreen trees grew in places where the ground was gentle enough to support them. They also caught glimpses of what looked like aspen trees high up in th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 mountains. They were traveling on a dirt path that winded through woodlands. They were still rather high up and te ground to their left slopped downwards and the grout to their right rose up to the towering mountains.\line \line 
Eventually the path began to descen\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 and they found themselves in an grassy area on their left they could see more gentle mountains covered in pine and for and the towering mountains continued to rise to their right.\line \line \line 
This is the same range we were in earlier we could have gotten here by t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
aveling north through the mountains but it would have taken many years if we ever could make it at all. The storms further can be sudden and violent.\line \line 
Now we will continue north and at some point we should hit a small road that leads to the city. There ar\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n't ma y farms or people around here most of them live father north and west of here.
\line \line they continues along and as late afternoon closed in they hit a larger road that seemed well traveled. The road turned and Elsie thought they were going to run straight\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
into the cliffs.\line As they got further they saw that the it was a wide opening between steep cliffs and the road ran ibti that.\line \line \line 
Steep mountains rose on both sides and a beatific brick wall woth round towers stretched across the opening.\line \line One two three fou\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 five six seven eight towers Addie counted. That's a very long wall!\line \line 
Yes it is Haley said. Who lives here again Elsie asked feeling a bit nervous after being away from people for so long. She also wondered who they were and what their lives were like.\line \line I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 can see why people become hermits she joked.\line \line It will be fun Susan said the followed up with what are they like?\line \line 
Oh their very nice Haley said. Kind and intelligent. There is a beautiful university that people come to earn at.\line \line There also very prosperous.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 In the north there is a port city and air of trade comes in from dwarves there are also some small dwarven settlements in the north too who lay quite well for the food that people grow.\line \line 
As they reached the main road it was quite large. They traveled up \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o it and soldiers stood at attention on either side. There were also soldiers on the wall tops.\line \line 
As they entered the gate they saw the city was bustling with life.\line \line Trees were everywhere and quaint little cobblestone paths wound through out there were als\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 trees everywhere so at times you felt you were lost inside a tiny forest.\line \line Haley explained it seems like a lot but there are three of these miniature forests inside the city.\line \line 
Steams and creeks flowed everywhere with sturdy wooden or stone bridges to get\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 across them. I much prefer crossing streams like this Elsie said with a laugh.\line \line 
The forest wasn't very long but they traveled up jill to get through\~ it. and they emegerged on the other end. They were actually much higher up now and they turned and looked\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
out over the valley. The people were all very friendly and would smile and say hello.\line \line What a lovely place Susan said. It would be grand to live here.\line \line 
Yes I agree Haley said and tonight wil be able to take warm baths and have a hot meal.\line \line That sounds lov\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ly said Elsie.\line \line \line \line Oh my are they?\line \line 
Friends Haley cut him off very close friends she said with a smile.\line \line Chapter 7\line The first thing she noticed about him was how sad his eyes looked, not hollow or empty they had a fire and a spark of life hidden deep down b

 He looked handsome but it was also hard to tell with his long hair and beard. He also looked ageless h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

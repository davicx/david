You think you know what it's like to be a high school student or what it's like to try and fit in but the thin\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 g\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  is it actually is pretty important.\~ \~
At least I thought so I mean I really believed that.\line \line But now I'm faced with different and far more terrifying questions what were the eyes that were watching me last night, will I be attacked in my sleep by what was

 in those painful\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
moments that made me realize a sleepless night can feel like a lifetime I've had plenty of time to think; to think about my past life and the kinds of questions that used to define my existence. I came to the realization that to me those questions did mat

There also were a side of carrots which everyone at my table ate about half and saved the other half for throwing. A quick toss when no one was look\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 i\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 but their reactions were the best by the second carrot there was both deep indignation and outrage.\line \line

\line \line "I wish we had something bigger to throw" Alex said\line \line If we need something smaller we can throw jonny" Austin replied\line \line 
Oh haha very funny jonny replied sarcastically and if we need something stupider we can throw you. Alex was small for his ag\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

We were given a small break and everyone began to talk happily I remember feeling strange like something was wrong but maybe my memories are incorrect. Class had just started up again\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

I set out, like a modern day Robinson Crusoe escaping his island, or maybe gilligan would be a better likeness. I felt nervous but double checked the raft one last time, food, oars, a small tarp shelter fishing line, water and

Raft against the strong ocean swells. The water was cold but the sand felt good on my feet.\line \line It was actually more \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 o\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
f a struggle then I realized to get it past the waves coming in. I had waited for the tide to go out but the raft was awkward especially when I had gotten to almost waste deep water.\line 
The waves were fairly large and seemed to break right over the top of wh\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
re I was standing. If it had been a day at the beach it would have been great but right now it was preventing me from setting sail.\line \line 
I finally reached the point where my feet lifted off the sand and I was swimming with my arms resting on the raft. Well it\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
was more like kicking with both feet then swimming but it was starting to work, it was a good thing the day was somewhat warm because I was totally drenched by now.\line \line 
I finally made it out last the big breakers and the sea grew calmer. Every journey starts\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
with a first step and in this case t was a paddle. I grabbed a hold and splashed the paddle into the ocean and began my trip out to sea.\line \line 
I have to say at this point that sailing out in the ocean raft was incredibly stupid. I probably should have waited o\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 n\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 th island for help, but something deep down inside told me help was never going to come. This led to my decision to sail as soon as I could while I was healthy and the. Weather was not too cool. I was almost sure now that it was late summer.\line \line 
As far curr\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

e strange thing happened. As I came up out of the water and opened my eyes I thought I saw a human face with blonde hair watching me off in the distance. It happened so fast and their was a glare from the sun on that part of the ocean and I decided it was
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 just a trick of my eyes. But it made me think of my friends and family and I wondered where they were and if they were ok.\line \line 
When I crawled back on the boat on though about how pure the water was. I lay in the sun wondering the implication could be. Of cou\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 r\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
se I was far out to see so maybe humans hadnt reached this far but something inside told me I was very alone. I also thought the feeling is natural considering I was a adrift in the ocean by myself but I had a nagging feeling whenever I made land I might 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 b\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e just as alone as I was right at the moment sailing on my little raft a small dot in the middle of a vast blue ocean.\line 
I lay for the rest of the afternoon staring at the blue sky being tossed by the waves and feeling both peaceful and lonely. I began to w\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 o\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
nder if I would ever make land and thought maybe I should turn around and head back for my island. What made me decide against it was I didn't know where my island was and I realized\~
 I would be fighting against the currents which is why I decide my best \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 p\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 lan was to keep sailing in whatever direction it was I was sailing towards.\line \line 
On the eleventh day out something interesting happened it was towards the evening time and I spotted something on the horizon. I used my paddle to push my self towards it and rea\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 l
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ized it was a small sandbar. There were even 5 or 6 coconut trees.\line \line 
Probably from coconuts that had drifted across the ocean lonely in search of a home. They landed adrift on this small island to go about their lives, reaching upwards towards the sun with\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
their branches and sinking their roots deeper and deeper. I imagined the cocoanuts drifting endlessly across the sea until by a twist of chance they landed on this tiny sand bar, Similar to me but hopefully I won't spend the rest of my life here.\line 
\line I lande\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 d\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  on the small sandy island and waded ashore as ocean water splashed all around me.\~
 it felt good to be standing on firm ground. If the island had been bigger I would have been tempted to stay longer if it was sufficiently large I may have stayed for a con\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 s\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
iderable time I was Nervous about setting sail again. The thought of a large storm thrusting my raft into the ocean had been growing on me. So far I had been lucky but I knew that one good storm could end my life. But I would starve on this small peaceful
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 island so I decide to just enjoy the night and then leave in the morning. I gathered palm fronds and made a large fire I also ate some coconut and warmed some of the milk.
\line \line I decided to inspect the small island, I counted all the palm trees, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 Seven trees not enough to support a human being. even one whose only other option was to sailback out into the giant vastness of the ocean, the burning sun and the aching lonliness not even broken by the sound of sea birds.\line \line 
The small island, or I should\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
say sand bar, was about thirty feet long and ten feet wide. The trees all grew in a clump in the middle and I harvested all of the coconuts. Either way it was heaven to me I ran around the island like a mad man splashing in the ocean and laughing. If you 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 h\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 in your freedom that's kinda what it's like.\line \line 
I kicked the sand up and watched it blow in the evening breeze I hugged a palm tree like it was a long lost friend and climbed one And knocked a coconut down the sheer joy of it made me laugh.\line \line After my out po

 I lay back in the sand exhausted and slightly worried that I was losing my mind. I felt my face, dang it was still mostly smooth if I was gonna go crazy at least I wanted a full\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 I have no idea what year it is or the state of the world. My nagging doubts had plenty of real evidence they may be real but I had no proof.\line \line 
As I recovered from my pent up days at sea I decided to try to catch a fish if I did I would be able to cook it.\line \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 I\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 put my fishing line out into the sea in hopes that I could catch a small (or large) fish to supplement my dwindling rations.\line \line 
It was definitely my lucky day because I managed to catch a small fish. Now normally i won't eat fish but I was somethsy of a ch\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

My father would be proud or would he? He always lectured me about stupid things I did, "so your friend dared you to roll up a roll of flash paper and pre\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
end you were smoking it you deserve to have the front of your hair singed." Hey its not my fault that it stuck on my lip as I went to spit it out and I didn't know flash paper burned that fast.\line \line 
He never thought to lecture me about setting sail on a small\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
raft alone with limited supplies on the mighty ocean. Well there is nothing I can do about that I am here right now on an island that can't support a life form as large as I so the only thing to do is continue my reckless voyage.\line \line 
I Laid on the raft just \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
he gentle swell of the ocean rising and falling and the lonely cries of the seagulls wheeling over head. It felt like my life was coming to an end and I felt sad I wanted the peacefulness to go on forever. The sun hung overhead\line \line 
I took the fish i had caug\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 h\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
t and cooked it over my fire and had coconut and fish and felt my strength revive. Human moods and emotions are a strange thing because while I was cooking and eating my dinner I felt on top of the world, like finding my friends and family and makin land 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 w\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ere just right around the corner.\line 
But after eating as I sat with my back to one of the palm trees and stared out and listened to the vast ocean and listened to the gentle waves roll in and off the small beach I was overtaken with an immense feeling of los
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 s\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  and loneliness. Deep down something told me the world I loved was gone. I dug my hands into the warm sand and watched as the sun slowly touched the edge of the great ocean.
\line As the sun set it set the skyline a blaze with brilliant shades of reds and orang\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
s the lonely island waves washed gently on the beach and I sat on a bed of palm leaves I had made.\line 
I had a feeling of the immense weight of time driving a wedge between me and hope. I stared at the sun until my eyes burned and felt the sun was larger and \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 o\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
lder both the sun and i might go about our lives never finding what we were looking for.\line 
The weight was too much to bear and I lay back in the sand and stared at the vast stars overhead. They were piercingly bright and so many I have seen the night sky fa\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 r\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 from civilization before but never had the stars been so bright. I didn't see Perseus or Orion or the Little Dipper or any of the constellations I recognized. What this meant about my location in time and space was not lost on me.\line 
I fell asleep to the so\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 u\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
nds of the ocean waves washing up on the beach. When I woke the sun was already fairly high in the sky. I went down and contemplated staying another day on the Island but decided I would get to bored and impatient and I only had limited food and water. Th
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 re was no fresh water on the island.\line \line No I decided I needed to leave at least on my raft I was going somewhere even if that some where was circles.\line \line 
The day started out brilliant but as I sailed I watched dull gray clouds gather across the vast horizon.\~ \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 I\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 had woken in a fairly good mood but the gray clouds lowered my spirits considerably. The day seemed to drag forever and after I had lost sight\~ of my island I had nothing to gauge time or how far I had travelled.\line \line 
This day the boredom was by far the wors\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 I had ever experienced around evening as the sunset the waves started to get more choppy and rough and my boredom was replaced by anxiety of an impending storm. The storm never seemed to come though\line \line \line 
I carved a small mark for each day that went by, I I \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 I\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 I I I I I I I I I I . 14 days I had been sailing I think the worst part was the boredom and loneliness. My emotions went up and down. The first couple days I was excited and hopeful but by day 14 I was starting to think that I was gonna die out here. It 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 w\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 as at this point I started to regret leaving the island.\line \line 
I didn't have long to regret because on the 15th day the skies gathered with pinkish looking clouds and I began to be concerned a storm was coming. When I went to sleep I lashed myself down with ro\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 p
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e and it was a good thing I did.\line \line 
A massive storm hit my raft and tossed my tiny raft about. The wind and rain and spray covered me and fear tore at me. I would rise up on a mighty wave only to be slammed down again as more giant waves rose all around me.\line \line 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 The sound itself was defeaning I felt pure terror and fear but somehow my raft stayed afloat and in one piece.\line \line \line 
The sea was fairly calm after the storm I laid on the raft in the soft sunlight slowly filtering down from the soft blue sky. I lat there dri\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 f\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
ting wherever it was the waves would take me to. I was completely exhausted and felt weak. I knew I would feel better if I are and drank but the storm had tossed everything into the sea. I would have been more upset but my foot was almost gone and so was 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 m\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 y water. My only regret was not eating and drinking it before the storm hit. Now they were lost forever to the depths of the ocean.\line \line 
My body and spirit where already weak from everything that had occurred and the three weeks at sea had not been kind. I kn\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
w it was a fools errand and I had vacillated between being glad I set sail to know feeling I had made a terrible mistake.\line \line 
But food was running out on the island and I didn't want to die there all though now I wonder if that would have been better then dy\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 i\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ng at sea.\line \line 
I knew I would be dead soon if I didn't make land and drink and eat something.\line \line The sun warmed considerably after the storm and I wondered where I be drifting. The ocean was a beautiful shade of blue in the late afternoon sunlight. It would ha
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 v\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e been a peaceful afternoon at sea ify situation wasn't so desperate.\line \line 
On the twenty second day I began to hallucinate and my throat burned like sandpaper. It was getting hot i think in the 90s but it was worse because i was totally exposed and the ocean \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 s
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 eemed to create a canopy of heat around me, the sun glared terribly of the surface of the ocean. I was so thirsty\~
 I couldn't stop thinking about water swimming in a nice cool pool, drinking a cool glass of water. I had that same desire for water like aft\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
r soccer practice on a late summer day. But then I knew my thirst would be quenched now I wasn't so sure. I began to think that it wouldn't be such a bad idea to drink the ocean water.\line \line 
I had always heard never to do that but in my current state it seemed\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
foolish to die of dehydration surrounded by water. I tasted a little but it was awful and salty and i decided to keep hoping for land and a creek. I think deep down I knew it wasn't gonna happen. But I still hoped!\line \line 
I began to grow more and more weak as I\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 drifted in this aimless state tossed and turned by the tides and eddies of the ocean.\line \line 
As I grew weaker I began to spend more and more time passed out with my shirt pulled over my head to shield me from the sun. I was so dehydrated (and hungry but I didn'\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

I fell asleep into fitful dreams and woke the next morning feeling weak and faint. I drifted o\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 f\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
f again into a state bordering on consciousness and unconsciousness. The whole day passed like this I remember the sun beating mercilessly down on me and also boredom. I passed out and awoke close to evening time.\line \line 
I was shacky but i still managed to unro\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 l\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
l the last line of fishing wire and cast it into the sea. I hoped maybe I could catch a small fish. As I stared up at the stars I wondered how much more I could drift like this I also wondered if anyone was looking for me but something deep down inside to

\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ter I would enjoy a nice ice cold Pepsi, no scratch that I would get a Starbucks smoothie something strawberry flavored.\line 
I awoke the next morning almost totally gone and disoriented. The sun was a little cooler and I think this helped keep me alive.\line \line It w\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
s in this state that the strangest thing happened to me. Four arms threw themselves up on the raft and two of the wildest and most beautiful faces I had ever seen pulled themselves up out of the water and looked at me. Two girls the wilder looking one of 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
he two had curly blond hair all dripping wet. The other one had jet black hair and was just as wild looking as her friend. I wasnt very afraid of them at the moment. this could have been how far gone i was or that they did not act threatening; though wild
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 I just sensed curiosity from them and a little bit of caution. I even felt a little like they were afraid of me.\line \line 
The shock called me somewhat back to my senses and I realized they were laughing about something the blonde one called out something and her \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 v\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

I realized she was calling to her friend a third girl that hung farther back then the r\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
st floating in the ocean. She had brown hair and I had thought the first two were beautiful but she far outstripped the other two girls and while she looked wild she was the least wild looking of the three and she also seemed like the most timid. I got th
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  feeling that they were almost like three teenagers playing a prank.\line \line 
They kept laughing and pointing. I realized they were pointing at my legs. And then. Splash they disappeared beneath the ocean surface. They came back up again further from the raft clo\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 s
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 er the the third girl.\line \line 
A wave came up and splashed the blonde girl in the face and her black haired friend laughed. This followed with the blonde girl splashing her friend with her hands I was surprised how much water they splashed at each other and then
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
they stopped and laughed as they caught their breath. They then sat contentedly rising and falling with the gentle ocean swell. By now the fog had burned off and it was a beautiful day.\line 
It wasn't hot but the sky was a the dark blue of the ocean and the sk\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 y\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  looked like the view you should see whole vacationing at a resort not dying on a raft.\line \line 
I started to feel weak and couldn't keep my head up. As my head fell back to the\~ \~raft I tried to keep my eyes on them but they had disappeared again.\line \line When I regain\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e

After a while something startled her and she dove gracefully back into the water barely making a splash. I realized there was a number of plants on the raft\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

It was still a ways off and I hoped it would swim away, but my hopes were not to come true. It sailed closer and I realized it was circling my raft. It disappeared and I hope\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 d\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

I had totally given up hope when I saw what looked like land off in the distance.the rush of joy overwhelmed me and with my last strength I began to paddle and swim towards the Land. As I got closer I could feel the waves pushing me in and then
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
I was sure it was land a rugged coastline covered in deep pine woods and rocky cliffs, at the moment I had never seen anything more beautiful as I created at the top of a wave I saw a small steam cascading off the too of one of the cliffs, water!\line 
\line I made \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 i\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

 some wild berries or anything edible. As I passed over the sand dunes I had to take a break to gather my energ\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 y\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
. As I sat I realized that the trees were far more massive then I had realized. Some of their trunks were easily 10 or 15 feet in diameter. I sat in silent awe of the giants and wondered how long they had been growing.\line \line 
It felt like I had stumbled into so\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 m\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
e primeval world. I began to walk to my left towards the cliffs that I had seen in hopes of finding water. I was still feeling exhausted and hoped they the woods would hold something I could eat.\line \line 
When I made it into the woods they were silent and peacefu\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 l\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
, they held great arching branches that spread above me like a sacred chapel. Small pieces of sunlight streamed through the branches and illuminates the grad and ferns and mosses for bring the floors.\line \line 
I paused for a minute taking in the immensity of it a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 l\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
l. As I sat listening I thought I heard a creek further ahead. I was now traveling up with the great ocean laying to my left.\line \line 
If I found the creek my plan was to follow it more or less inland. If there were people wherever i was I hopefully could find th\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
m before I starved. As I walked through the vast undergrowth I was struck by the mighty pillars of the pine trees rising up far far above me.\line \line 
And then I saw the steam buried beneath grassy banks. I rushed forward barely able to contain my joy and threw m\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 y\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
self drinking the cool clear water. It was the most amazing taste and one ill always remember with gratitude. After I had drank my fill I briefly worried that there might be something in the water that would make me sick, but then I also thought sick mean
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 s\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 not dead and thats a more appealing alternative. I felt my energy come back and began to walk slowly along the mountain steam. I was winding slowly up hill through the wood and it felt like I was walking though a dream.\line \line 
A gentle evening breeze blew thou\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 g\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
ht the tress and the leaves made a nice comforting sound. It helped because after being out at sea for so long I had to regain my land legs it felt like I was still pitching at sea.\line \line 
I had climbed a considerable way up when I decided to stop for the night.\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 I had found a grassy meadow and over the tops of it I could see the ocean. It felt like the place you would have a wedding, I could picture the lights hanging and tables set and all the guests dressed in nice suits and dresses.\line \line 
For some reason I clearly\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
pictured myself at one of the tables wearing nice dress clothes and I was talking and laughing happily with the girl I had met on the raft. Was she real did I imagine it, I wasnt sure.\line \line 
The thought made me happy but also miss everyone. The water had made \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 m\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
e too and I looked around and the pone and for and oak trees and ferns and tall green grass and wondered what was edible. I also thought about.\line \line 
I followed the creek all the next day but it was increasingly harder among the overgrown banks. I began to wad\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 among the stones along the bank. Towards the end of the night I was tired and hungry and wondering if there was any civilization to get too. I was so sure all I had to do was make it to land and I would be saved but here I was better off then at sea but 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 s\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 till facing starvation.\line \line 
I wondered what I could eat, I felt like I remember that you could eat fern fronds but I was not sure. I also thought maybe you could drink tea made from boiled pine needles but I had no way to make a fire.\line \line In the end I just laye
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 d\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 down is some tall grass and drifted off to sleep with the night noises all around me. When I woke I was cold and felt achy. I was also wet, and heard the gentle potter patter of rain falling the forest leaves. If I had been inside it would have been a co

y morning. One to eat a breakfast of potatoes and bacon. Then have an active day and curl up with a nice book by a fire in the evening. But my day involved surviving. And that included finding food. With the creek by my side\~
 I had plenty of cool clean wa\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 er that hadnt made me sick. But now I needed food.\line \line 
I got up and continued along the creek bed. The cloudy skies had given way to a beautiful blue sky that turned a lovely shade of dark blue.\line \line The undergrowth along the side of the stream was less so I cam\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
 up and waded though the grassy banks. The whole first felt ancient the tress so broad and majestic. The ground had slopes steadily upwards and I was fairly high up the mountain pass. At a small grassy clearing I turned and stared out, far away in the dis
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ance I could see the ocean stretching out below.\line \line 
I wondered what elle was up to and doing myself missin her. Strange when I didn't even know if the whole thing had been a hallucination. A also stared up at the sky and looked for any aero plan that might \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 b
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e crossing the sky. I imagine the joy I would feel know want that there were other humans.\line \line 
As it was i continued to walk though the wonderland around me. The dark green of the giant pines the thick lush grass that grew and the ferns. I couldn't remember \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 s\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
eeing beauty like this in a long time. That night something Alarming happened. As I was sleeping i suddenly woke and saw a pair of eyes up on the hill watching me. It scared me terrible but I continued to lay still.\line \line 
I layed still not sure what to do. I k\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 n\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
ew whatever it was it was watching me. I thought about running then decided that I was too weak from not eating and my best bet was to lie still. Eventually whatever it was went away but I couldn't fall back to sleep. I just layed shivering and cold and m
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 i\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

To keep my mind busy I tried to imagine where I might b\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 . It had to be somewhere remote.\line \line 
I finally reached the end of the creek and it fed into a mountain lake. Beautiful blue mountains stood around me and the area felt peaceful and serene but I was discouraged and felt lost. I was weak and all the mountains 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ppeared steep. I layed on my back in the grass and rested my eyes in the after noon sun.\line \line 
The lake was beautiful high mountains stood around it and trees and forests crowded around most of its banks.\line \line I sat up resting my back against a large oak tree, the\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
ground under it was a thick carpet of beautiful green grass.\line \line I had my eyes shut then heard a noise that sounded like a horse whinny.\line \line I opened my eyes and just about jumped out of my skin.\line \line 
The most giant knight sat a board a beautiful massive charger.\line \line \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 H\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

He leveled his massive lance at me as he sat upon his massive battlle horse.\line I knew my life hung by a thread the lance looked like a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 small tree\line \~

\line \line \line The giant statue sat motionless and I thought for sure I was going to die. But I also marveled at the size of his massive charger. Id never s\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 en\~

A deep voice rang out from the motionless war helmet. What is you name? The vice seemed to be a part of the \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 arth so deep and wild yet calm and in total control.\line \line

Where am I is this earth?\line \line Are there mermaids \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 h\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ere?\line \line Hmm yes eyes I believe this place used to be called that.\line \line Now it has many names.\line \line 
What do you know of the merfolk?\line \line Well alex said, I am still not sure if its a dream but i think they saved me when I was adrift at sea.\line \line Interesting,\~ interesting he\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 mused. The merfolk are very suspicious and a good judge of character. If they did help you that is very rare and surprising. Usually they keep to themselves and you can't blame them.\line \line 
Why is that Alex asked him.\line \line It's quite sad he said. They were hunted g\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 r\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
eatly by seafarers who sold them. A disgusting and regrettable business. Now they have withdrawn into their own kingdoms underneath the mighty\~ ocean.\line \line 
It's rumored they come ashore and lay in the sun on small islands covered in sun and the great blue sky\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 that hands above it.\line \line Have you ever seen one asked Alex.\line 
\line No I am not much of a seafarer he laughed, my brother is but he usually travells to the north which is covered in ice and snow and rock. The merfolk don't go to there the water is to cold. It's too\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 cold for many bears except out white cousins. There cities are wondrous and quite comfortable, have you been to the north?\line \line 
Alex paused well no, to be honest I'm still trying to figure out where it when I am.\line \line Yes I'm sorry it's obvious you have been thro\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 u\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 gh a lot.\line \line 
What year is it?\line \line It's the year 57 of the second age.\line \line Well I suppose you could say it was over 2000 years bc where I was from.\line \line A quizzical look passed over the bears face but he didnt say much.\line \line 
He seemed uncomfortable, then started to speak,\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 we have a policy.\line \line You seem I'm a soldier in the brigadioon.\line \line \line 
We have a policy that anyone caught in the wastelands must be taken prisoner and brought before the queen.\line \line Me a prisoner alex laughed. Well I would probably have died soon anyways.\line \line Then he g\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 o
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t serious Ihope they don't put me in prison though.\line \line No. No the bear replied, and I like you if you want me to look away whole you escape that's fine.\line \line Well truthfully I don't have anywhere to go.
\line \line Well good. You can be my guest I never liked that law Any\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 w\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ays.\line \line If you need to bind me when we get close I understand Alex said.\line \line 
I am almost back to my camp he said. When we get there we can make dinner and get settled in.\line Alex was thrilled at the thought of sleeping with blankets and being full and content.\line \line T\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 h
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ey winded their way along a small dirt trail covered with grass on both sides. To their left the lake spread out and on their right deep pine covered slopes rose up to tall mountains in the distance.\line \line 
Will we have to cross those Alex asked?\line \line Yes unfortuna\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
ely we will he said. They run mostly parallel to the ocean. Will head north about a days journey and there we will find a path that we can take. If it doesn't snow it's about a four days journey over the mountains and then about 3 days back to the first c
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 i\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ty. We can stay at inns the rest of the trip which will be about 2 days.\line \line 
He beamed a big smile and I know the best inns with the best food. Then he paused pensively, but you will be a bit of an oddity.\line \line How so Alex said.\line \line None of the other creatures have\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 seen a human, your a thing of legends, a mythical creature. A few of our scholars study humans and they are considered well, well they don't get taken very seriously to say the least.\line \line 
What do you think will happen when they see me?\line \line I'm not sure he said \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 i\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 n his deep voice. i suppose\~ they will have to believe he smiled.\line \line 
It will be nice to be back I have been gone a long time.\line \line How long have you been gone he asked.\line \line It's been a full year he said.\line \line Wow Alex said that is a long trip where have you been.\line \line I j
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 o\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 urneyed up the Coast into as far as the icelands. There I spent the winter with the wolves learning about them and their culture.\line \line 
Normally there was peace but lately the wolves and the bears have been having conflicts over land and resources.\line \~Get to cam\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 p\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  eat\line \line 
The next day they packed up and set out they winded their way up gentle forested hills into the deeper mountains.\line \line As they're camp he set up four small lanterns on posts around the four corners and lit them.\line \line 
What are those for Alex asked?\line \line The spir\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 i\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ts don't like them he said.\line \line Spirits Alex asked nervously\line \line 
Yes he said some of them are good but many are evil and quite dangerous.\line \line They didnt harm me when I was sleeping alex said.\line \line Yes they inhabit some places more then others, there haven't been many \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 round here they prefer darker places but at night it's best to be careful.\line \line There biggest weapon is fear. Notice is known about them but they have been increasing more and more.\line \line 
That was actually party of my mission to the north. Ten of us were sent but \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 he other ones came back I wanted to journey farther north.\line \line 
The were worried about my safety coming back but so far I have been safe and I enjoy traveling by myself from time to time.\line \line Oh no I hope I didn't intrude alex said. Your quite fine I was ready f\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 o
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 r some company, and it's even better when your with a mythological beast. He smiled.\line \line Yes I suppose that's true alex laughed.\line \line 
They continue for many days traveling over the mountains and through the pine and fir and evergreen forests.\line \line Alex felt quite sa\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 f\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e with his large companion.\line 
\line They walked up the grassy slope. It was all so beautiful that Alex felt like he was walking in a dream.\line \line Beorn! He heard the excited yells and looked up to see squirreles tearing out of the trees towards them.\line \line They began to c
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 l\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
imb higher up into the rugged mountains. The slopes were covered in pine an fir and the ground was steep and rocky and they often could turn and see far out over the mountain ranges they were traversing.\line \line 
At times it felt like he was striding atop the clo\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 u\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ds like some ancient Titan come back to life.\~ The mountain range broke and fl in jagged peaks covered in rock and trees.
\line \line They crested a large mountain almost touching the bright blue sky laced with white clouds slowly drifting forever across the sky. Th\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
y descended into a gentle mountain valley Streep mountains rose all around them as they descended the slope down a small mountain trail Alex caught glimpses of a small village tucked in the far corner.\line Who lives there he asked.\line \line 
Dwarves he said there very\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 friendly and they have a great inn will sleep warm and dry tonight. Will also eat well warm door the inn keeper and his wife are delicious cooks.
\line \line It's a bit out of the way but well with it.\line \line Yes look at those storm clouds gathering it would have been a c\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 o\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ld and wet one tonight from the looks of it.
\line \line As they descended the pass they saw a stone tower built into the living rock.\line \line The village looked like it was from a storybook. Quaint little houses about 30 or 40 of them with thatched sides and brightly pain
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ed shares of color.\line \line 
They descended through the forest then came our I to the grassy mountain valley. Alex felt so good under the sun and cool breeze. Look at that beorn said pointing to the dark clouds gathering on the far peaks.\line \line I'm glad will be inside
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 before the stu hits Alex said.\line \line 
Yes it will be just in time. They continued through the valley at a diagonal angle until they hit a well made small road that ran to te village.\line \line The village is a little bit larger then it first appears because some of the 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 s\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 hops and houses and blacksmiths love in the mountain.\line \line 
He pointed upwards and up there if you look there is a small dwarven house. It's inside the mountain but their veranda is carved out in the mountain. They are very nice peopl that love there and will \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 v
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 isit them.\line \line It's very rare for dwarves to live atop a mountain like that. Most prefer to be deep underground.\line \line 
They continues along the path bright green grass and trees covered the valley and tall steep precipices and mountains circled them in all around\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 the distances.\line \line 
Two soldiers came out of the tower he knew at once they were dwarves with their wild beards for a second hw was nervous at how quick I they were approaching but he mistook their energy. It was excitement, beorn they yelled practically thro
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 w\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 ing themselves on the giant bear. They looked like small children compared to him.\line Good to see you beorn boomed out embracing them in a hug that almost hid them from site.
\line \line They all began heading back to the village.\line \~By the time they made it to the villa\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 g\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 
e the clouds had started to gather and the first rain drops had statues to come down. A friendly young dwarf came out who knew beorn, I'm topple he said smiling as he introduced him self to Alex. Alex liked him at once he was wearing leather work clothes 
\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 a\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 nd had a large beard and smiling eyes.\line \line Ill take care of your horses he said cheerfully its nice to have you here beorn he looked with admiration at ye giant bear.
\line \line It's nice to be back he replied I'm looking forward to some of the delicious food we have \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 e\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 aten good on the trail but not nearly as good as we will eat soon!\line 
\line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line \line Chapter 8\line Dusk fell swiftly as the waning daylight faded. Alex used the light to quickly try to set up his tent. As he was doing so he noticed beorn Pull out a number of think w

After he had the first one lot it began to give off a pleasant smelling smile almost like citrus.\line \line Would you like me \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 t\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

Beorn straightened up and looked over at him. Your not familiar with them he asked.\line \line \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506 He seems reluctant to talk about it. It's not the best thin to speak of at night he mused slowly.\line \line 
Alex walked over closer\line \line Beorn sighed you've not heard of the twilight ones.\line \line No Alex replied suddenly very curious. Well he said they are common in these\hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506  \hich\af31506\dbch\af31505\loch\f31506

What to wear to school tomorrow, if I would make the basketball team if I should take down a post with only 8 likes, these are important questions in fact they can be quite consuming. You think you know what it's like to be a high school student or what it's like to try and fit in but the thing is it is pretty important.   At least I thought so I mean I really believed that. But now I have learned a lot and I've got stories I can tell the grandkids. If I live long enough that is and also if there's anyone else alive on this island called earth. On this place that used to be called earth. I think that was its name, I've been thinking of changing it.

Ok let me be clear at this point I really don't know what's going on and I'm getting ahead of my self so ill go back and fill in what I can remember. The memories are beginning to piece themselves together; at about the same rate that the cold and hunger and loneliness threaten to end all memories for good.

But there are other questions, in fact they might be more important, what are the dark eyes that were watching me last nigth, will I be attacked in my sleep by what was watching me night will I freeze to death before the winter ends or will I be lucky and starve to death long before then. My life changed in the blink of an eye, but I don't remember the blink. In fact I'm beggining to wonder if I ever existed in those dim memories, dad coming home in a  suit after an important meeting, lighten off fireworks late on a warm Fourth of July, walking on the hot asphalt to seven eleven to get Pepsi and cheap donuts
Then lighting off fireworks on the Fourth of July. Going blackberry picking in the bright green meadows on a late autumn day. Picking pumpkins at the pumpkin patch and drinking hot chocolate as the snow gently comes down covering the city in a soft white blanket.

Watching the leaves fall as they burn bright orange reds yellows in the Autumn, the crunch of soft snow and the first signs of green as spring comes

It makes me ache inside with loneliness just thinking about them and all the people I miss.

Maybe I should back up a little, my memories, if they are mine, are fragmented and the pressing darkness has left me scattered and afraid. But I do remember this

"Sweety, muffin cheeks" a high pitched voice yelled from a dirty beat up green mini van with wooden paneling.

I felt my face go bright red "Johnny
Come on and hurry your grandma has to go to the bathroom and you remember what happened at thanksgiving"

 The high pitch yell came right as two attractive girls were walking by me Nicole  and her friend jenna it's like my brother and his friend had some sixth sense for how to embarrass me the most. Nicole had talked to me once freshman year and I never got over it. Most of the time she just walked around looking disgusted and better then everyone. She only talked to her friend.

Nicole turned with her friend and looked at me they both laughed, were they laughing with me or at me? Nicole was the only person I knew who could look So superior when laughing. I felt my face turning bright red.

"it's not my mom I mumbled about to try to explain it was my older brother who had apparently just got back From college.
They kept walking so I stopped talking
 The voice called out again, "jonny you better hurry.

Him and his friend apparently found two wigs that they put on to try to make themselves look like two old ladies and now were having a bit of fun.

That day was September 25, 2017 the clock was ticking exactly one month left and I had no clue. October 25 2017 the beginning of the end.
The end of everything

October 25  the day the whole world sat glued to their TVs watching in horror until slowly the electricity bled it self out from everything and the world went dark for the last time.

Well that is somewhat untrue October 25 was the terrifying day that started it all, the whole world sat that day glued to their TVs watching in horror until slowly before the end of the year the electricity bled it self out from everything and the world went dark for the last time. Who would ever imagine it would start so innocently with a missing plane. By the fourth missing commercial plane people began to panic but as time went on people forgot about the incidents and they let their fears sleep.

The memories have come back sharp and clear, it was a normal day at school a Thursday. Dustin was being particularly rambunctious in fourth period and had just gotten detention. Lunch had been pizza and it wasn't bad at all. There also were a side of carrots which everyone at my table ate about half and saved the other half for throwing. A quick toss when no one was looking and then we all focused intently on the lunch in front of us. Hoping no one, particularly a teacher had seen us throw anything.The goal was to hit the freshman cheerleader table or the robotics club table. Why those two as targets? I'm not totally sure but their reactions were the best by the second carrot there was both deep indignation and outrage.

"Whose doing that" I heard a high pitch squell" as a carrot scored a direct hit.

Haha nerds and cheerleaders sound the same when their angry Austin laughed stupidly.

"I wish we had something bigger to throw" Alex said

If we need something smaller we can throw jonny" Austin replied

Oh haha very funny jonny replied sarcastically and if we need something stupider we can throw you. Alex was small for his age his parents were also very wealthy and he was spoiled. He got teased a lot for being small and had evolved quite a sharp tongue. He was also pretty cocky and fit in well but Austin still teased him.

Stupider then a carrot? Ya that's probably true Austin said. Come here austin lunged across the table with mustard on his fingers that he waved dangerously close to Jonnys expensive and preppy polo shirt. as jonny backed away. Austin was big and not too bright but I sometimes felt he played it up a little everytime I snuck a peak at one if his tests he always had an a.

Hey guess what my mom had to help me get dressed this morning Austin laughed

Eww jonny replied you seriously have issues.

Jonny and Austin were actually pretty good friends and they liked to tease each other. Jonny also had a crush on Austin's mom she was single and still very attractive she had Austin when she was young and even now was probably in her early thirties.

Hey watch this Austin said. No don't three of us tried to say at once as Austin there a rotting banana.

Direct hit.

Austin Daniels you get over here right now! A teacher had seen.


Ms Janes bust into the room her face as pale as a ghost.

I even had the audacity to be bored that night
I have a lot of regrets but I ways loved my family and that whole month we got along great we always did I was blessed, blessed for 17 years

These are the memories that I pieced together but I should back up to the day I was born well I call it that day because it felt like I came from a void as dark as a . Of course on that day I was almost 18, well that's another thing biologically I was 17 my body was 17 my mind was 17, well actually mentally I acted about 13 or 14 lets see about to start college in one year and i still laughed when someone said uranus.

but there is always time to grow up later. That last part is a bit confusing so let me be clear my last memory was of being 17 i know for a fact i have lived at least 17 years, but how many more? I had been 17 a while and then came the darkness I have no recollection of time so I could be 17 still, but I'm beginning to think that a LOT of time passéd while I was covered in my watery cell. I think I may be far more ancient, the lives of kings, rulers and entire empires just quick flashing memories like a passing road sign on a road trip, last chance to get gas, stale donuts and shirts with wolves howling at the moon for 120 miles.

Ahhh I gasped for air everything was darkness total and complete blackness. I was also totally  wet with close walls around me smooth and deathlike. A powerful humming noise like a generator shutting down could be heard outside.
My tomb encased me all though I was too disoriented to know that death was pressing in, all I had was a primal instinct, oxygen I need oxygen. I shoved my face into the top corner of the dark tube in casing me and gasped again the air was getting stale i would be dead in minutes i thrust out with my arms and legs trying to free myself in any way possible. There was about 8 inches between the water and the lid that contained the quickly depleting oxygen that stood between me and a sudden death.

Panic set in I didn't know who I was I didn't know my name, everything was blank just the overwhelming urge to live and to breath. I thrust out again at the roof harder this time and my hand caught something hard and sharp near the top. I felt it cut my hand and the blood come out fast and strong into the dark cold water around me. I felt myself going dizzy and in fear, terror and panic began hitting whatever it was that had cut me. Once, twice, three times! Over and over I struck but on the last time I felt it give with a life saving noise the top of the tube shot open on its hinges flooding the area above water with air. I gasped in as I pulled myself up and rested my arms on the edges of the tube. I had managed to hit some kind of escape latch that must have rusted shut.

I was cold and wet I felt around the edges of the tube for a way to pull myself free but felt nothing. I could touch the bottom of the tube if I sub merged Myself, I think the overall tube was about 8 feet deep and 2 feet wide. The walls were completely slippery and solid The water came up about 7 feet in the tube. I hung on the edge exhausted, Listening to the strange sound of the humming noise as it seemed to be slowing down. The generator sounded massive but at this point I was still totally disoriented. I really knew nothing no memories of who I was, of my past or any clear idea of the present; where I was or really any perception of reality. Just a few basic feelings cold, dark, exhaustion and a throbbing pain where I had cut my wrist. Something told me there was more to life then the tube I was in and the dark water around me. Trying to get out made me realize how trapped I was the sides were round but everything was wet and slippery. The total and complete dark made it even more difficult to come up with a plan of action. I was also totally weak I began to worry that perhaps I might drown after all.

 I lay on the ground bleeding and exhausted but alive and I intended to stay that way. As the darkness pressed around me I felt pale and hopeless. I also began to remember another feeling, hunger.
It was intense between the throbbing of my hand, the hunger and the total exhaustion I was beginning to think that escaping from the tube was going to end up being pointless.


Maslow has a hierarchy of human needs, right now I was in desperate need of all of them. I was like Robinson Crusoe trapped in an icy and forbidden world.

I opened the door and found a Geiger detector. We had used one in high school science and I was familiar with how they worked. There were about 5 of them on a shelf and I


I looked out and soaked in the fading daylight and was hit by a blast of icy air. The view almost took my breath away, maybe that was the cold. I looked out over the vast icy snow clad mountain range stretching endlessly as far as the eye could see, dark powerful mountains taunting me to try and survive their Wintery wrath. There was beauty too, the giant mountains were Gorgeous shades of blues, whites and purples. They were mostly what looked like evergreens I also saw a lake a few miles further down.

Chapter 3
Do you think you of all gods creatures would be the only ones to evolve

Chapter 4
I set out, like a modern day Robinson Crusoe escaping his island, or maybe gilligan would be a better likeness. I felt nervous but double checked the raft one last time, food, oars, a small tarp shelter fishing line, water and the emergency kit I had found.

The shore was relatively warm and I had cut my jeans into jean shorts. I waded out into the ocean pushing the
Raft against the strong ocean swells. The water was cold but the sand felt good on my feet.

It was actually more of a struggle then I realized to get it past the waves coming in. I had waited for the tide to go out but the raft was awkward especially when I had gotten to almost waste deep water.
The waves were fairly large and seemed to break right over the top of where I was standing. If it had been a day at the beach it would have been great but right now it was preventing me from setting sail.

I finally reached the point where my feet lifted off the sand and I was swimming with my arms resting on the raft. Well it was more like kicking with both feet then swimming but it was starting to work, it was a good thing the day was somewhat warm because I was totally drenched by now.

I finally made it out last the big breakers and the sea grew calmer. Every journey starts with a first step and in this case t was a paddle. I grabbed a hold and splashed the paddle into the ocean and began my trip out to sea.

I have to say at this point that sailing out in the ocean raft was incredibly stupid. I probably should have waited on th island for help, but something deep down inside told me help was never going to come. This led to my decision to sail as soon as I could while I was healthy and the. Weather was not too cool. I was almost sure now that it was late summer.

As far currents, tides, monsoon seasons I had no idea, I wasn't even sure what ocean i was in. The thing is 6 months is long time alone. And this led to my somewhat rash decision. I didn't want to die alone on this island, but don't get me wrong it would have been a nice place for a vacation with some friends.

As it was I think that I caught a current because over the course of the day I watched the island sinking away on the horizon. It was gradual but I could see that I was making progress  some where.
The seventh day out was relatively warm and by mid afternoon the sun had warmed my little raft up a lot. The blue water spread out around me began to look more and more inviting so I  decided to take a dip in the cool ocean whole staying close to my raft
Right before I plunged in I wondered how deep the ocean was and how far away the sandy floor might be. I also wondered what creatures might be below me; particularly of the shark variety. But it was too late, splash! The cool water felt good and I swam around my raft and enjoyed the refreshing ocean. Some water splashed in my mouth and I didn't drink it but the water tasted pure it was salty of course but much fresher then when I had gotten a mouth full trying to surf off the California coast south of San Luis obispo.
One strange thing happened. As I came up out of the water and opened my eyes I thought I saw a human face with blonde hair watching me off in the distance. It happened so fast and their was a glare from the sun on that part of the ocean and I decided it was just a trick of my eyes. But it made me think of my friends and family and I wondered where they were and if they were ok.

When I crawled back on the boat on though about how pure the water was. I lay in the sun wondering the implication could be. Of course I was far out to see so maybe humans hadnt reached this far but something inside told me I was very alone. I also thought the feeling is natural considering I was a adrift in the ocean by myself but I had a nagging feeling whenever I made land I might be just as alone as I was right at the moment sailing on my little raft a small dot in the middle of a vast blue ocean.
I lay for the rest of the afternoon staring at the blue sky being tossed by the waves and feeling both peaceful and lonely. I began to wonder if I would ever make land and thought maybe I should turn around and head back for my island. What made me decide against it was I didn't know where my island was and I realized  I would be fighting against the currents which is why I decide my best plan was to keep sailing in whatever direction it was I was sailing towards.

On the eleventh day out something interesting happened it was towards the evening time and I spotted something on the horizon. I used my paddle to push my self towards it and realized it was a small sandbar. There were even 5 or 6 coconut trees.

Probably from coconuts that had drifted across the ocean lonely in search of a home. They landed adrift on this small island to go about their lives, reaching upwards towards the sun with their branches and sinking their roots deeper and deeper. I imagined the cocoanuts drifting endlessly across the sea until by a twist of chance they landed on this tiny sand bar, Similar to me but hopefully I won't spend the rest of my life here.

I landed on the small sandy island and waded ashore as ocean water splashed all around me.  it felt good to be standing on firm ground. If the island had been bigger I would have been tempted to stay longer if it was sufficiently large I may have stayed for a considerable time I was Nervous about setting sail again. The thought of a large storm thrusting my raft into the ocean had been growing on me. So far I had been lucky but I knew that one good storm could end my life. But I would starve on this small peaceful island so I decide to just enjoy the night and then leave in the morning. I gathered palm fronds and made a large fire I also ate some coconut and warmed some of the milk.

I decided to inspect the small island, I counted all the palm trees, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Seven trees not enough to support a human being. even one whose only other option was to sailback out into the giant vastness of the ocean, the burning sun and the aching lonliness not even broken by the sound of sea birds. 

The small island, or I should say sand bar, was about thirty feet long and ten feet wide. The trees all grew in a clump in the middle and I harvested all of the coconuts. Either way it was heaven to me I ran around the island like a mad man splashing in the ocean and laughing. If you haven't been adrift alone on a small raft for days you probably won't understand. Maybe you have been couped up in a mini van on a vacation driving for a couple days and spending every minute in the van or in a hotel. Well when you finally get back and regain your freedom that's kinda what it's like.

I kicked the sand up and watched it blow in the evening breeze I hugged a palm tree like it was a long lost friend and climbed one And knocked a coconut down the sheer joy of it made me laugh.

After my out poring of pent up emotions fueled by worry exhaustion loneliness and poor diet.  I lay back in the sand exhausted and slightly worried that I was losing my mind. I felt my face, dang it was still mostly smooth if I was gonna go crazy at least I wanted a full wild beard to go with my insanity. How could I be almost in college and still not able to grow a beard. How could I be almost on college and the last living human on earth. No, I can't think like that I told myself. I have been on an island and a sand bar I have no idea what year it is or the state of the world. My nagging doubts had plenty of real evidence they may be real but I had no proof.

As I recovered from my pent up days at sea I decided to try to catch a fish if I did I would be able to cook it.
I put my fishing line out into the sea in hopes that I could catch a small (or large) fish to supplement my dwindling rations.

It was definitely my lucky day because I managed to catch a small fish. Now normally i won't eat fish but I was somethsy of a changed person, funny how starving with the possibly of starving to death can make you far less picky.

 My father would be proud or would he? He always lectured me about stupid things I did, "so your friend dared you to roll up a roll of flash paper and pretend you were smoking it you deserve to have the front of your hair singed." Hey its not my fault that it stuck on my lip as I went to spit it out and I didn't know flash paper burned that fast.

He never thought to lecture me about setting sail on a small raft alone with limited supplies on the mighty ocean. Well there is nothing I can do about that I am here right now on an island that can't support a life form as large as I so the only thing to do is continue my reckless voyage.

I took the fish i had caught and cooked it over my fire and had coconut and fish and felt my strength revive. Human moods and emotions are a strange thing because while I was cooking and eating my dinner I felt on top of the world, like finding my friends and family and makin land were just right around the corner.
But after eating as I sat with my back to one of the palm trees and stared out and listened to the vast ocean and listened to the gentle waves roll in and off the small beach I was overtaken with an immense feeling of loss and loneliness. Deep down something told me the world I loved was gone. I dug my hands into the warm sand and watched as the sun slowly touched the edge of the great ocean.
As the sun set it set the skyline a blaze with brilliant shades of reds and oranges the lonely island waves washed gently on the beach and I sat on a bed of palm leaves I had made.
I had a feeling of the immense weight of time driving a wedge between me and hope. I stared at the sun until my eyes burned and felt the sun was larger and older both the sun and i might go about our lives never finding what we were looking for.
The weight was too much to bear and I lay back in the sand and stared at the vast stars overhead. They were piercingly bright and so many I have seen the night sky far from civilization before but never had the stars been so bright. I didn't see Perseus or Orion or the Little Dipper or any of the constellations I recognized. What this meant about my location in time and space was not lost on me.
I fell asleep to the sounds of the ocean waves washing up on the beach. When I woke the sun was already fairly high in the sky. I went down and contemplated staying another day on the Island but decided I would get to bored and impatient and I only had limited food and water. There was no fresh water on the island.

No I decided I needed to leave at least on my raft I was going somewhere even if that some where was circles.

The day started out brilliant but as I sailed I watched dull gray clouds gather across the vast horizon.  I had woken in a fairly good mood but the gray clouds lowered my spirits considerably. The day seemed to drag forever and after I had lost sight  of my island I had nothing to gauge time or how far I had travelled.

This day the boredom was by far the worse I had ever experienced around evening as the sunset the waves started to get more choppy and rough and my boredom was replaced by anxiety of an impending storm. The storm never seemed to come though


I carved a small mark for each day that went by, I I I I I I I I I I I I I . 14 days I had been sailing I think the worst part was the boredom and loneliness. My emotions went up and down. The first couple days I was excited and hopeful but by day 14 I was starting to think that I was gonna die out here. It was at this point I started to regret leaving the island.

I didn't have long to regret because on the 15th day the skies gathered with pinkish looking clouds and I began to be concerned a storm was coming. When I went to sleep I lashed myself down with rope and it was a good thing I did.

A massive storm hit my raft and tossed my tiny raft about. The wind and rain and spray covered me and fear tore at me. I would rise up on a mighty wave only to be slammed down again as more giant waves rose all around me.

The sound itself was defeaning I felt pure terror and fear but somehow my raft stayed afloat and in one piece.


The sea was fairly calm after the storm I laid on the raft in the soft sunlight slowly filtering down from the soft blue sky. I lat there drifting wherever it was the waves would take me to. I was completely exhausted and felt weak. I knew I would feel better if I are and drank but the storm had tossed everything into the sea. I would have been more upset but my foot was almost gone and so was my water. My only regret was not eating and drinking it before the storm hit. Now they were lost forever to the depths of the ocean.

My body and spirit where already weak from everything that had occurred and the three weeks at sea had not been kind. I knew it was a fools errand and I had vacillated between being glad I set sail to know feeling I had made a terrible mistake.

But food was running out on the island and I didn't want to die there all though now I wonder if that would have been better then dying at sea.

I knew I would be dead soon if I didn't make land and drink and eat something.

The sun warmed considerably after the storm and I wondered where I be drifting. The ocean was a beautiful shade of blue in the late afternoon sunlight. It would have been a peaceful afternoon at sea ify situation wasn't so desperate.
 
On the twenty second day I began to hallucinate and my throat burned like sandpaper. It was getting hot i think in the 90s but it was worse because i was totally exposed and the ocean seemed to create a canopy of heat around me, the sun glared terribly of the surface of the ocean. I was so thirsty  I couldn't stop thinking about water swimming in a nice cool pool, drinking a cool glass of water. I had that same desire for water like after soccer practice on a late summer day. But then I knew my thirst would be quenched now I wasn't so sure. I began to think that it wouldn't be such a bad idea to drink the ocean water.

I had always heard never to do that but in my current state it seemed foolish to die of dehydration surrounded by water. I tasted a little but it was awful and salty and i decided to keep hoping for land and a creek. I think deep down I knew it wasn't gonna happen. But I still hoped!

I began to grow more and more weak as I drifted in this aimless state tossed and turned by the tides and eddies of the ocean.

As I grew weaker I began to spend more and more time passed out with my shirt pulled over my head to shield me from the sun. I was so dehydrated (and hungry but I didn't realize it) that i began to feel less of the original emotions I had experienced fear was gonna discouragement, frustration now I simply felt Hungry and weak.

I fell asleep into fitful dreams and woke the next morning feeling weak and faint. I drifted off again into a state bordering on consciousness and unconsciousness. The whole day passed like this I remember the sun beating mercilessly down on me and also boredom. I passed out and awoke close to evening time.
